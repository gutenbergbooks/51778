<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p><i><span class="dropcapit">T</span>HESE lectures were delivered in the
Slade School, University College, at
the request and suggestion of Professor F.
Brown, and, I believe, were the first, or
among the first, serious attempts in this
country to point out all the various methods
of making and reproducing drawings for
book and newspaper illustration.</i></p>

<p><i>Since they were first delivered, now some
three winters ago, courses of lectures on
illustration, and classes for instruction in
drawing and engraving have been started
in almost all art schools.</i></p>

<p><i>It seemed to me, therefore, that a small
manual on the subject might be useful.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
<i>There is no attempt in this book to define
Art, or even to tell the student how to
draw; that he learns in his ordinary
school work. Still less is there any endeavour
to dictate, or even suggest, any especial
style, or manner of handling, or technique.</i></p>

<p><i>But illustration is, up to a certain point,
a mechanical craft, which must be learned,
and can be learned, by any one. And
ignorance of the requirements and absolute
necessities are evident all around us.</i></p>

<p><i>The book, therefore, might rather be described
as a series of tips or hints&mdash;to
put it on as low a plane as possible&mdash;the
result of practical experience, which should
enable the student to make his drawings so
that they will produce a good effect on the
printed page; but, first of all, he must be
able to make the drawing well. No one
can teach him that; but he can be taught
what materials he should use, where he can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
get them, and how he should employ them.
That is all I have tried to do.</i></p>

<p><i>As I have said in this book repeatedly,
processes are discovered and perfected
almost daily. Since these lectures were
last given, the method of etching zinc and
copper half-tone blocks has been entirely
revolutionised. Now, there is no inking
up of plates; the photograph on the metal
serves as a protecting and acid-resisting
ground, and the biting is done as simply
as in ordinary etching; though, of course,
it is the lines or dots which are left in
relief.</i></p>

<p><i>Possibly before the book is out, even
greater improvements and developments may
be made.</i></p>

<p><i>Nor have I attempted to describe all the
tricks, dodges, and clever schemes employed
in newspaper offices for making blocks from
photographs, or for the rapid reproduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
of sketches, such as drawing on lithographic
transfer paper, making photographic enlargements
on fugitive prints. All are
most useful and valuable in their way, but
not exactly what one would tell a student
to do. If he becomes an illustrator he will
learn these things fast enough.</i></p>

<p><i>As the book is passing through the press
Mr. W. Lewis Fraser, the art manager of
&ldquo;The Century&rdquo; magazine, writes me that
he thinks it &ldquo;a good practical book, likely
to be of much use to the young illustrator,
and save the art editor many a pang and
many a sorrow.&rdquo; I hope so, and it is with
this hope that the book is published.</i></p>

<span class="lecture">WHAT IS ILLUSTRATION?</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE craving for pictures, that is, for
illustrations, is as old as the world.
The cave-dweller felt it when he scratched
on the walls of his house, or carved the
handle of his battle-axe; one there was
&ldquo;who stayed by the tents with the women,
and traced strange devices with a burnt
stick upon the ground.&rdquo; Others painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
themselves blue, and were beautiful; and
these were the first illustrators.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were the most prolific,
and their works may be found, monuments
more durable than brass, not alone in their
places, but scattered to all the corners of
the earth.</p>

<p>From the Egyptians and the Assyrians
we may skip, offending but the arch&aelig;ologist
and the pedant, to the illuminators who
threw their light on the Dark Ages. They
changed their methods from carving to
tracing, and their mediums from stone and
papyrus to parchment and vellum.</p>

<p>But always these illustrations were single
works of art, they were not reproduced,
and only duplicated by copying by hand.</p>

<p>Beautiful as are the manuscripts, they
play but a small and unimportant part in the
history of illustration, when compared with
the block books that follow them; though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
block printing is but a natural evolution
from the stamp on the bricks of the Egyptian,
or the painting on the vases of the Etruscan.</p>

<p>The block books, more often loose sheets,
were printed from designs, picture and text,
cut on the wood, in one piece, sometimes
possibly engraved in metal. These blocks,
being inked, and having sheets of paper
placed on their inked surfaces, and the paper
being rubbed, gave off an impression; as
many blocks having to be cut as there were
pages, and as many impressions having to be
taken from each block as there were copies
desired. The first of these illustrated
blocks is the St. Christopher, 1423, though
playing-cards, produced in the same way,
were known much earlier.</p>

<p>It is only, however, with the invention
of printing with movable types, practised by
the Chinese centuries before we ever thought
of it, that illustration, in its modern sense,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
may be said to have been created; though
printing with movable type is but the cutting
up into separate letters of the pages of the
block books. As soon as the artist was
able to make his design upon a block of
wood, have that engraved, and set up in
the press with movable type, and print from
it, a new art was discovered.</p>

<p>From the day of Gutenberg and Sch&oelig;ffer,
illustration has, in the main, never changed;
new methods have been employed, new processes
for making the blocks have been
perfected, but an illustration still continues
to be a design on a wood block or metal
plate, so cut, engraved, or etched as to produce
a printing surface from which impressions
may be taken, either in connection
with type, when we call it letterpress or relief
printing, or separate from the type, when it
usually becomes intaglio or plate printing.</p>

<p>These methods have undergone, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
still are undergoing, incessant modifications,
developments, and improvements; and anyone
who wishes to take up illustration as
a profession or a study, must learn the
rudiments of the science, as well as master
the great principles of art, if he wishes to
succeed.</p>

<p>To-day, the methods of making the design
are many, but the methods of reproducing
it are virtually endless; still one must try
to learn something of the most important,
and the more one understands the requirements
of drawing for engraving and printing,
the better will be the results obtained.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century one had but to
design the picture on the side of a plank,
write in the text in reverse, cut everything
else away, wet the block thoroughly, ink
the face of it, lay damp paper over it, and
rub or press the back of the sheet of paper
till the ink came off on it, producing a print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
To-day one must understand drawing in
all sorts of mediums, know something of
the effect of photographing a drawing on
to the wood block or metal plate, take at
least an intelligent interest in engraving on
wood and metal, understand process and
lithography, and be prepared to struggle
with that terrible monster, the modern steam-press,
and its slave, the modern printer. To
do this intelligently requires, not only a
training in Art, but in the arts and sciences
of engraving, reproduction, printing; and
it is to these arts and sciences that I propose
to call your attention.</p>

<p>An illustration&mdash;using the term in its
artistic sense&mdash;is a design intended to give
an artist&rsquo;s idea of an incident, episode,
or topographical site, or it may be but a
mere diagram referred to by a writer;
and an illustrator is one who makes pictures
or illustrations which illustrate or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
explain his own text, or that of another
writer.</p>

<p>An illustration really is a work of art,
or rather it should be, which is explanatory;
but, as a matter of fact, so too is all graphic
art, explanatory of some story, sentiment,
emotion, effect, or fact; and it would be
very difficult indeed to point out when art
is not illustrative.</p>

<p>As the word is used to-day, however, an
illustration is a design made for the purpose
of publication in book or magazine or paper.
The fashion of making such designs to
accompany lettering or type is, as I have
shown, as old as the art of writing. The
art of illustration, or rather the existence
of illustration as a separate craft, and of
illustrators as a distinct body of craftsmen,
is virtually the growth of this century, more
properly of the last sixty years since the
invention of illustrated journalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
Until the other day illustration had no
place among the Fine Arts, and it has been
said that, to win renown, an illustrator must
achieve it in some other branch of art.</p>

<p>A few great artists of the past have made
illustrations which will be prized for ever,
and to-day these men are spoken of as
illustrators; with D&uuml;rer and Holbein it was
but one of the many forms of art in which
they excelled, but they were not altogether
given up to it.</p>

<p>To-day, however, illustration is the most
living and vital of the Fine Arts, and among
its followers are found the most able and
eminent of contemporary artists.</p>

<p>It cannot, however, be said that this prominence
which has been so suddenly thrust
upon illustration is altogether due to its
increase in artistic excellence; there are a
number of other reasons.</p>

<p>Illustration has indeed reached technically,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
on the part of artist, engraver, and printer,
such a point of perfection, that it has at
length forced critics and amateurs to give
it the attention it has so long demanded.</p>

<p>More important reasons are the developments
in reproduction and printing, started,
and to a great extent carried on, merely
to lessen the cost of production, but capable
of giving better and truer results in the
hands of intelligent craftsmen, than anything
previously known.</p>

<p>Still, cheapness in reproduction by process,
cheapness in the cost of printing, has
enabled numbers of absolutely ignorant
people (ignorant, that is, of art), but possessed
of, they think, fine commercial instincts,
to start illustrated papers and publish
illustrated books. The result has been that
an army of out-of-works in other fields of
art, of immature or even utterly untrained
students, escaping from the hard labour and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
drudgery of an art school, ignorant even of
the fact that great illustrators have always
studied and worked before they have found
a chance to start, have rushed into illustration.
They are led blindly by the advice of
the blind, they find even manuals on the
subject written authoritatively by people who
are either not artists, engravers, or printers,
or, if they do pretend to practise any of these
arts and crafts, are unknown and unheard of
among the artists with whom they would rank
themselves; and more wonderful still, the
pupils of these blind leaders of the blind find
publishers and printers ignorant enough to
employ them; but not so ignorant as to pay
more than the wage of an inferior servant
for the worthless work supplied them.</p>

<p>There are many of these papers, magazines,
and books being published to-day&mdash;eminent
authors even contribute to their
pages; but the illustrations they contain are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
more primitive in their depth of ignorance
than the work of the cave-dwellers, and
would be equally valuable to future ages if it
were not that they were mainly made up of
an unintelligent cribbing, and stealing from
photographs and other men&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Therefore, as a mass, instead of advancing,
illustration is sinking lower and lower, owing
to the action of those who pretend to be
its patrons; at the present moment we
find ourselves in a critical situation, good
work crowded out by mediocrity&mdash;because
mediocrity is cheaper&mdash;real artists lost
sight of amid the crowd of squirming,
struggling, advertising hacks. Any spark
of originality is stamped out if possible.
The mere attempt to say anything in one&rsquo;s
own fashion is a crime, and on all sides the
prayer for the extinction of the artist is
heard; after him will go the process man
as the commercial wood engraver has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
vanished, and then&mdash;well, things will take
a new start, good work will be done, and
we may as well prepare for the time coming
soon, when cheapness and nastiness, having
struggled to the bitter end, will kill each
other for want of something better.</p>

<p>Still, to-day, as good work is being done
as ever there was; only cheapness has to
shriek so loud, and advertise so large, to be
seen at all, that people are deafened by the
shrieking, and at times the best is but seen
through a glass, darkly. Nevertheless, good
art will as surely live as bad will perish.
Let us then endeavour not only to learn
what good work is, but how to do it. In
the near future this will be absolutely
necessary. When one sees the greatest
artists in England drawing for penny
papers, one realises that illustration is
only apparently in a bad way, that really
we are entering upon a second renaissance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
that this is but the dark moment before
the dawn.</p>

<p>As a preliminary, and also a final, word
to you, I would say, you must draw, draw,
draw first, last, and all the time, and until
you can draw, and draw well, you cannot
illustrate.</p>

<p>The study, therefore, of the equipment
of the illustrator should be our aim&mdash;what
he must do before he can make good illustrations,
then, how he is to make them.</p>

<br />
<span class="lecture">THE EQUIPMENT OF THE ILLUSTRATOR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HREE special qualifications are absolutely
indispensable to the artist who
desires to become an illustrator.</p>

<p>First, in order to make the least important
illustration, the student must have a sound
training in drawing, and if he has worked
in colour so much the better, for in the near
future colour work will play a very important
part, even in the least costly form
of books and papers.</p>

<p>Second, the student must thoroughly
understand the use of various mediums, oil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
(in monochrome at least), water colour, wash
and body colour, pen and ink, chalk, etching,
lithography, and he must have ability to
express himself by almost all these methods.
A knowledge, too, of the appearance the
drawing will present after it has been engraved
on wood or metal, processed, etched,
or lithographed is necessary, because the
illustrator will be held responsible for the
results on the printed page; even though, as
is usually the case, the fault is that of the
engraver or printer, the public certainly will
blame the artist alone. Therefore the editor
or publisher will not employ him. The engraver
will blame him if only to save his
own business reputation. The printer will
take away in every case many valuable
qualities which the drawing possessed; but
for the incompetency or inability of engraver
and printer, the artist will be held accountable,
and he must therefore understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
engraving and printing well enough to
place the blame where it belongs, if not
on his own shoulders.</p>

<p>To be able, then, to obtain good printed
results, requires a knowledge of the reproductive
arts, on the part of the illustrator,
in theory at least, almost equal to the practical
skill demanded in drawing.</p>

<p>Third, but most important of all, the
ability to discover the vital or characteristic
motive of an author&rsquo;s work, and so set it
forth that the public may see it too. And
the power to do this well is without doubt
the real test of an illustrator.</p>

<p>Nothing is more difficult. The artist must
please the author, therefore he should if
possible know the writer personally; at least
he must be in sympathy with, and interested
in his work, else a difference arises at once;
jealousy between author and artist, nearly
always the fault of the author, who usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
resents the presence of the artist at all, is
the cause of half the failures in illustration.
No artist would think of dictating to an
author the fashion in which the latter should
write his story, but every author, and not
a few editors, try to tell their own artist how
it shall be illustrated. To a certain extent
this is right, and it would be altogether
right, if only the author and editor knew
anything of art; but not infrequently they
do not, and the less they know the more
they dictate.</p>

<p>It may be safely said that not once in a
hundred times is the author satisfied with
his illustrations, especially if they are made
to decorate a story. And even the designs
intended to illustrate a descriptive article
seldom please the writer, simply because the
author has no comprehension of the limitations
of graphic art.</p>

<p>Still, with descriptive articles, the case is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
somewhat different. If the illustrator knows
the author, he may undertake the journey, if
to a foreign land, for example, with him, and
a most delightful piece of collaboration may
be the result. Or the author having visited
the spot&mdash;sometimes he writes about it without
having done so&mdash;may make out a list
of subjects, and the artist may pick and
choose from them, going to the place
described to do so, with more or less satisfactory
results. It is in this way that most
of the better known magazines obtain their
illustrated descriptive articles, but even by
this method the artist and author usually
disagree as to what should be drawn, the
matter being looked at from two entirely
different points of view. Or the artist may
be asked to work up into drawings, from
photographs, views of a place, or portraits
of people never seen by him; some illustrators
are very successful at this, work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
which in most men&rsquo;s hands would be but
the veriest drudgery and hack work, becoming
interesting, attractive, and truly
artistic.</p>

<p>But in most cases such drawings, even
by the most skilful men, lack the go and life
obtained when the work is done direct from
nature, or at least without the photograph;
and every true artist prefers nature to any
photograph. There is nothing in the world
more difficult to work from. One is
confused by endless unimportant, unselected
details; the point of view is never that
which one would have selected, and the
result, save in the rarest instances, is dubbed
photographic even by the artless.</p>

<p>The most awful misfortune that may
occur to an illustrator is to be compelled
to use the photographs or sketches made
by an author; here almost certain disaster
awaits the artist. The author who cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
draw but will sketch is terrible; the author
who can photograph is impossible. Both, they
are sure, could make the illustrations if they
but had the time; and the artist who is
compelled to illustrate them could write
the story or do the description, he knows,
if he but took the trouble. At least, that
is the view they take of each other. The
result is almost certain failure.</p>

<p>Such people should contribute solely to
the journals of actuality, where neither art
nor literature find an abiding place, and
the photograph, the amateur, and the personal
paragraph are supreme.</p>

<p>Despite all these things, and many more,
people struggle to become illustrators.</p>

<p>Another qualification for the illustrator
is education; no ignorant person may
become a decent illustrator. He need not
possess an university degree; few do.
But he must be able to understand a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
vital or dramatic or pictorial point, and to
arrive at this understanding may necessitate
much study of literature at home
and the visiting of many lands.</p>

<p>How can one illustrate a history of
Napoleon, for example, without reading
everything possible about his life that the
author read, and without visiting the
various countries in which his life was
passed; in short, the conscientious illustrator
goes through exactly the same
process as the author, when collecting his
materials. With this difference; the author
is, in most cases, the final judge of his
own work, and of his artist&rsquo;s efforts too.
It is amazing that, considering that an
illustrator has to submit to having his
work judged by editors, rejected by
authors, spoiled by engraving, injured by
process, and ruined by printing&mdash;and all
this may happen to good as well as bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
work&mdash;armies of young people are rushing
into an over-crowded profession, and every
art school, by teaching illustration, is encouraging
them to do so.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that such is the case, my
object is to endeavour to give you a
start in the right way if possible, at least
in the way that, up to the present, the
best work has been done.</p>

<p>That is, briefly, by drawing well, by
working carefully, by expressing ideas
plainly, and these desired results can only
be obtained by those who regard illustration
quite as seriously as any other branch
of the Fine Arts; who know the good work
that has been done in the past, and working
on the right traditions, adapt their
methods to the requirements of the present.</p>

<p>There are many more points to be noted,
not least of which is that an illustrator
must learn to keep his temper; from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
first drawing he submits, until he takes
to painting in despair, his work will almost
surely be misunderstood, his motives disbelieved.
If he works in the style affected
by his paper, that is, the style which the
editor considers appeals to his subscribers&mdash;for
papers are published for gain, not love&mdash;he
will be asked by the critic why he
does so. If he dares to be original, to
follow his own inclinations, he will be
told to efface himself and work like the
rest. If he sketches he will be accused
of shirking his work. If he elaborates
he will be told he is ruining the proprietor.</p>

<p>His only consolation is that he, personally,
seldom sees the editor, he prepares
himself for the ordeal, and as the
editor has to encounter a constant succession
of irate, contrite, emphatic, and even
furious artists, his life cannot be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
altogether happy one. Still he flourishes, and
so does the illustrator.</p>

<p>But there are compensations. One may
be asked to illustrate the works of a
deceased author, one may treat the volume
almost as one likes, and discuss the result
with the editor. In this case the artist will
almost certainly do his best. If he has the
true illustrative spirit, he will study the period,
the country, the manners, the costume; and,
if let alone, to produce the work in his own
way and at his leisure, he may create a
masterpiece. This, however, depends entirely
on the artist. It is in this way that the great
illustrated works of the century have come
into existence, without hurry, without worry,
and, after all, the pleasure of work has been
almost the only reward the artist has gained&mdash;and
that seems to be enough to attract
crowds&mdash;but I doubt if the business side of
illustration means much to the student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
Better still, the artist may make a series
of drawings, and then get a writer&mdash;an
artist in words&mdash;one of those people who
talk of impressionism in prose, or impasto
in poetry, to turn out so many yards of
copy. With what a grace he does so, and
with what glee the artist pounces on his
lines! If it were not for the ever-present
editor the author&rsquo;s lot would be almost as
bad as the illustrator&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Best condition of all under which work
may be produced is when the illustrator is
his own author, when he writes his own
story or does his own description; this
requires that one shall be doubly gifted.
Much may be learned by practice, but to
be really great in this has as yet scarce
been granted. But a few very talented
artist-authors exist.</p>

<p>Equally good are those magazines that
publish illustrations which are independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
works of art, of equal importance with the
text.</p>

<p>Equally pleasant, too, is working for the
weekly illustrated press&mdash;how long this form
of publication will last is doubtful&mdash;making
drawings which will be printed of a large
size and show really the ability of the artist.
It is pleasant, too, when the editor is an artist
or man of sympathetic intelligence.</p>

<p>Another very important matter is the
recognising of the fact that illustration at
its best is equal in artistic rank with any
other form of artistic expression; and that
in every country save England illustrators
rank with any other artists. Here one is
forced to take to paint to gain admittance
to the Royal Academy, though most of the
distinguished members of that body won
their reputations, and live on them, not by
colour, but by the despised trade of illustrating.
Critics&mdash;even the best of them&mdash;will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
tell you that an illustrator is just a little
lower than a painter. It is false if the art
of the one is as good in quality as that of
the other; else Rembrandt&rsquo;s etchings are
inferior to his paintings, which is absurd.</p>

<p>But to-day many illustrators, in fact the
mass, do not take themselves seriously.
They squabble and haggle, they hurry and
push, they are as much shopkeepers as your
out-of-work painter. Others must have
their stuff in every paper. Others&rsquo; portraits
and eventless bourgeois lives appear in every
magazine, especially if the portrait is done
for nothing and a few drawings are thrown
in. Others crib the superficial qualities of
the popular one of the moment, whether his
game is eccentricity, mysticism, or primitiveness,
three excellent dodges for hiding
incapacity or want of training.</p>

<p>Not that there are no good men who do
find their means of expression among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
primitives or who are really mystic, or truly
grotesque, but for every one of these there
is an army of frauds.</p>

<p>But all the while good work is being done.
You may not see the real artist&rsquo;s name in
letters a foot long on every hoarding, or his
productions in every book that comes out.
But once in a while he does an article, or
even a drawing and then the mystics, the
hacks, the primitives, and even some few
of the public, buy it and treasure it up.</p>

<p>Therefore be serious, be earnest; and if
you cannot be&mdash;if you think illustration but a
stepping-stone to something better&mdash;leave it
alone and tackle the something better. You
may never succeed in that; you will certainly
fail in illustration.</p>

<p>There is still another point, the financial
one. Here illustration approaches architecture.
Ruskin said somewhere, probably
by accident, for it is so true, &ldquo;Never give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
your drawings away; tear them up or keep
them till some one wants to buy them.&rdquo;
At the present time the profession is so
crowded at the bottom that some shopkeeping
editors have profited by this to
reduce their prices almost to nothing&mdash;literally,
by threatening and sweating, obtaining
the work of mere students and people
who are without money or brains, though
they may be possessed of artistic ability,
for next to nothing. In the case of painters
they have said, &ldquo;Send us a photo or sketch
of your picture, and we will put it in; and
think of the advertisement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What you who want to be illustrators
must think of is that the painters who give
their work to these people are fools. Would
a writer give his story for nothing, or a poet
his sonnet? And when these editors say
they can get such an one&rsquo;s drawing for so
much less, tell them to get it, they will come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
after you on their knees later if you have
anything in you, or their papers do not come
to grief in the meantime.</p>

<p>Of course there can be no hard-and-fast
rule about remuneration, but the labourer is
worthy of what he can get. And it has only
been within the last few years that the clever
dodge of swindling the public by bad photos
and worse art, of sweating artists by employing
hacks and students has been practised,
for the benefit of two people, grasping
proprietors and still more grasping editors.</p>

<p>In connection with this matter, let me
read you an extract from a letter recently
received by me from the greatest living
illustrator (it is therefore unnecessary to
mention his name), and read at one of the
meetings of the Society of Illustrators:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has for too long been the case that
the unsuccessful practitioner of other arts
has turned to illustration of the baser sort as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
a last chance of earning a living. I dare
say he has a right to a living, but in these
days of cheap and nasty illustrated journals,
the low standard of work he brings, as a
rule, to a branch of the artistic calling
always considered by me a dignified and
important branch, I do not believe in
recognising or encouraging; and it certainly
seems to me that a certain distinction
should be made between men who take not
the slightest artistic interest in their work
and those who conscientiously endeavour to
do it well and honestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen the abnormal growth and
prosperity of cheap and nasty illustration,
to my great regret. I suppose that so long
as there is a large market for it, men will
be found to supply it, and evidently this is
the sort of thing finding favour to-day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The standard set up by the &lsquo;Cornhill&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Once a Week,&rsquo; and by Menzel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
Meissonier abroad, seems to be out of key
with the present taste. It must be that
ignorance of good work is responsible&rdquo;&mdash;ignorance,
I may add, on the part of the
artist and editor&mdash;in their case intentional
or deplorable; in the case of the public it
is but the blind leading the blind.</p>

<p>Therefore, finally, try to do good work,
and when you have done it demand to be
well paid for it. If you have not the moral
or financial backbone for this, go and chop
wood&mdash;or paint.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>LECTURE III.<br />
<br />
<span class="lecture">METHODS OF DRAWING FOR REPRODUCTION
IN LINE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is no doubt that to-day the
most popular method of designing
the decoration of a book (I use the word
book, but I would refer to magazines and
papers as well) is by means of line work.
By the use of what materials these lines are
to be made; how they are to be placed upon
paper or metal that they may reproduce and
print best; and the way in which that reproduction
and printing is done, will be the
subject of this and subsequent lectures.</p>

<p>The line has always been employed, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
only by artists, but by the artless, to express
form; the only difference being that the
artist uses a vital line full of meaning, the
artless a meaningless line without vitality.
But often the work of the two approaches
so closely that at times it can scarcely be
distinguished; however, that is a critical,
and not a technical, matter.</p>

<p>I do not propose to give you a history of
the methods employed to obtain lines, in
fact, a history of drawing. There are many
such books, and as for drawing you study
that every day, in the life and antique, and
I hope outside as well. But it is to line work
and its reproduction in the present, that I
wish to call your attention.</p>

<p>The most generally adopted method of
making a line drawing for illustration to-day
is with a pen and ink, upon white
paper. There are but four tools, and a
surface to work on required. The tools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
are simple and cheap enough, the ability
to use them rightly and well is rare enough,
even though every book is decorated and all
newspapers are to be illustrated in the near
future.</p>

<p>First, as to the pens: there is, as you
know, an endless variety of them, all the
best. Some are made specially for the
artist, and of these the most generally
used is Gillott&rsquo;s 659 (all colourmen keep
them), a barrel pen, which fits a special
handle; when one has mastered this pen,
unsympathetic, hard and scratchy at first,
and each pen, by the way, has to be broken
in, one finds that the most amazing variety of
line can be obtained with it, from the most
delicate to the boldest. The beginner thinks
because it is a small tool that only small work
can be done with it; experience and practice
will prove to him that it is a most sensitive
implement, and he will learn to take care of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
his pens, keeping them on the holder in a
box which they just fit, for these pens improve
with age, getting better and better
until they are almost like living things, and
then they break.</p>

<p>From this most delicate and sensitive of
pens I would call your attention to the
hardest and most unsympathetic, the glass
pen, or stylus; this is a useful tool, but
while the Gillott is to be used in work demanding
freedom of touch and consequent
variety of line, the glass pen is only to be
used&mdash;unless you like it&mdash;when lines of
uniform thickness are wanted. It carries
a large quantity of ink, and, as lines can be
made in any direction with it, it is more like
an etching needle than anything else I know
of; and if these pens were really well made in
metal and not of glass, and of different sizes
and would give lines really varying in
width, they would be much used; as it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
they are very unreliable, easily broken, and
expensive. I find that they are liable to
tear up the paper, or refuse to work in an
annoying fashion. It has been pointed out
that they are most useful for tracing, and
also that if they clog up they may be easily
cleaned by dipping in water and wiping off
with a dry rag. I may say that they should
be thoroughly wiped, and in fact all pens
should, after they are cleaned, or the ink is
changed, as you may not only spoil your
pen, but your ink as well, by dipping your
pen without cleaning, either in water or
another sort of ink, as one ink may contain
some chemical matter which absolutely
ruins another. Some rubber should be
placed in the bottom of your inkstand, for
if the glass pen drops heavily it will be
broken; but not paper, unless you wish to
spend all your time wiping pulp off your
pen. The best of these pens I have found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
are those sold by Roberson, 99, Long Acre.
Between these two extremes, of flexibility
in the Gillott, and firmness in the stylus,
are to be found all sorts and conditions
of pens. And I may say that you may
never like, and you need never use, any
special kind, but instead your favourite
writing pen; if you like that best, it is the
tool for you, use it. There are, however,
some other sorts of pens to which I may
call your attention. If only some fountain-pen
maker had the sense to invent a pen
for artists, he would make his fortune. But
fountain-pens at present are unreliable in
action and unsuitable for use with drawing
inks, so they are out of the question altogether
for us.</p>

<p>A very good tool is the quill pen. Much
variety can be obtained with it, especially
in broad dragged work. I use technical
terms because you understand them, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
hope, and it is only the technical side of
illustration I propose to touch. With the
back of this pen you can get rich and
broken effects, especially when it is half
dry. The quill, the stylus, and the reed,
were the tools for pen-drawing used by
the old men. You can buy quill pens
anywhere. Reed pens you had better
make for yourselves; go to a reed bed in
the early summer, cut off the top of the
stalk, strip off the outer covering, and cut
the inner canes into sections between the
joints, cut your pen and finish it at once,
or rather a lot of them, for when the reed
is dry it is liable to split and is not half so
flexible.</p>

<p>Pen work with reed pens really should
only be done when they are fresh; but at
all times they glide easily over the paper,
though any pen will do this after you
have mastered it. Reed pens also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
make a broad fat line and hold lots of
colour.</p>

<p>Another pen which is useful sometimes is
Perry&rsquo;s Auto-Stylo, or marking pen, from
Perry&rsquo;s, Holborn Viaduct; lines half an inch
broad or as fine as a hair can be made with
it, and I have at times used it as a brush;
it is a most amusing instrument.</p>

<p>Brandauer&rsquo;s round pointed pens are used
by some. But the pen you should use is the
pen you can use; that is, the pen with which
you can get the most variety of line. Or
you may use half a dozen, from the finest
Gillott to the biggest reed. It is not the
pen, but the person who uses it. Sometimes
it is not a bad thing to remember this.</p>

<p>Many artists are now taking up the use
of the brush; most probably it was used by
the old men, certainly the men of the last
generation employed it, as it was much
easier to work on the wood block with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
brush than a pen. And we know that the
Japanese pen is a brush. The advantages
are flexibility of line, amount of colour it
will hold, freedom from scratchiness, and
absolute freedom of movement in every
direction&mdash;the greatest advantage of all&mdash;the
line itself is fuller and fatter, more
pleasing. The drawbacks, well, there
scarcely are any, save that to use either
brush or pen well is about as difficult as
to play the violin; that is all.</p>

<p>The commonest brush for line work is
that used by lithographers, a sable rigger
which they cut to a fine point, removing the
outside hairs; but almost any good pointed
brush will do. Very good indeed are the
genuine Japanese brushes, the small thin
ones are the best&mdash;in black handles&mdash;you
can pick these up sometimes at the Japanese
dealers, but I imagine any artist&rsquo;s colourman
would send to Japan for them if there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
was a sufficient demand; I have got them in
quantities for a penny each.</p>

<p>There are various mechanical tint tools
like air brushes in use; they are of little
importance to the artist, and if you want a
dotted tint you can get it by dipping a toothbrush
in ink and rubbing the inked hairs
with a match stick, when the ink will be
splattered in dots and blots all over the
paper. You may lay a piece of paper on
the parts you wish to keep white, and paint
or scratch out spots that are too dark, or you
may impress your inked thumb or pieces of
inked silk on the paper, or indulge in any
trick of this sort that amuses you and gives
the desired result.</p>

<p>Ink is probably the most important material
employed in pen-drawing. It must be
good, that is, it must be black&mdash;it should not
shine&mdash;it must never settle, it must flow
easily, dry quickly, and never clog the pen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
There are many varieties of good ink, but
the only ink I know of to-day, which gives
me exactly what I want and is obtainable of
the same quality all over the world, all over
Europe at any rate&mdash;and this is an enormous
advantage&mdash;is Bourgeois&rsquo; Encre de Chine
Liquide. During several years it has never
varied, and that is more than I can say of
any other. It is indelible, a desirable
quality in ordinary use. The only bad
thing about it is the vile, ill-balanced bottle
and the rotten cork, which always breaks and
often gets you into a mess. The best bottle
I have ever seen is that in which Higgins&rsquo;
American drawing ink comes.</p>

<p>This is not a talk on inks, but a hint as to
what I have found the most satisfactory and
reliable&mdash;if you do not like this one, every
colourman makes an ink or sells some
one else&rsquo;s; try it. Among the best are
Higgins&rsquo;, Winsor and Newton&rsquo;s,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
Newman&rsquo;s, Rowney&rsquo;s, Reeves&rsquo;, Stevens&rsquo; ebony
stain.</p>

<p>Freshly-ground Indian ink is the best of
all, but to grind up your ink is too much
trouble, too tedious and too unreliable to
be worth the bother it entails. Indian ink,
under certain conditions, shines and glitters,
and this is not pleasant, and hinders photography.
Lamp black and ivory black are
quite dead and free from shine, but they are
not fixed colours. They may be easily fixed
with gall or gum.</p>

<p>Writing inks usually, if not always, have
blue in them; therefore they will not photograph,
they run about, blot, and generally
misbehave. Sometimes one gets good black
writing-ink; when you do get it, use it.
But Indian or Chinese ink is best, and
as I know of no better preparation at
present, I commend Bourgeois&rsquo; Encre de
Chine Liquide; it comes in the tall bottle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
with the diagonal black and yellow dragon
on the label. Coloured inks, save blue, may
be used, but unless the illustration is to be
printed in that colour the result is almost
always disappointing; delicate washes of
brown, for instance, becoming staring solid
blacks.</p>

<p>In sketching out of doors with ink, a
method I most strongly recommend, pour
your ink, or rather enough of it, into
an exciseman&rsquo;s ink-bottle, one of those
unspillable affairs which you can cork up&mdash;though,
save to keep the dust out of them,
there is no occasion to do so&mdash;and attach
it by a sort of watch-guard to your buttonhole,
putting the bottle in your pocket.
Messrs. Newman, 24, Soho Square, have
fixed up some of these bottles for me, and
they will, I have no doubt, supply them.</p>

<p>The general way with artists is to put
their uncorked ink-bottle in their waistcoat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
pocket; if they should happen to lean over,
on straightening up the ink is found upon
their trousers or frocks, or sketch-block&mdash;in
the male a result most conducive to
strong language, especially if the trousers are
spoiled; the drawing doesn&rsquo;t so much matter.</p>

<p>Also provide yourself with a hardish lead
pencil H., or, better, a blue one, as the
blue doesn&rsquo;t photograph, but it&rsquo;s hard to
get off the paper, and don&rsquo;t look well; also
some lithographic crayon or Wolff&rsquo;s carbon
pencils; a good rubber, pure rubber or
bread for the pencil, an ink rubber or
eraser for the ink; some Chinese white
and gum for patching up things; and for
use in the house, an old razor to scratch
out, and out of doors a folding eraser,
such as Mr. Percy Young, of Gower
Street, supplies: get the folding ones, as
the others are not only less convenient but
rather dangerous to carry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Lastly, the paper: the photo-engraver
will tell you Bristol board. Certainly, a
simple open line drawing in pure black
upon pure white smooth paper, very little
reduced, should give a truer result than
anything else. But what it does really
is to give engraver and printer less
trouble, and that is what most of them
want; in the majority of cases it is best
to aid them, otherwise your work is spoiled.
Therefore, if you like Bristol board, use it,
and use it whether you like it or no, if you
are doing work for ordinary printing. But
if your illustration is to be well engraved
and well printed, use what paper you like.
But to get satisfactory results from rough
paper requires much experience, and you
had better arrive at that experience by
doing simple things, in a fashion which
will engrave well; go to printing offices
and engravers&rsquo; shops, find out what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
necessary, try to work in harmony with the
engraver and printer, and they will do
their best for you: most of them care about
their work, and are genuinely sorry if they
cannot make yours look well, so work with
them, and they will work with you.</p>

<p>As to the Bristol board, get the best; if
the drawing is large and has to be rolled
up, the thin, if not the thicker quality; it is
known as so many sheets, two, four, six
sheets the heaviest. You must get the
best quality, otherwise there is a risk of
bad spongy places in it, which may
almost ruin the drawing, at any rate its
appearance, and necessitate patching up
which is delaying and annoying. Bristol
boards, too, may always be made up into
books or blocks. Some boards are now
mounted so that they can be stripped off
the mount when the drawing is finished,
among them are Turnbull&rsquo;s Art Tablets;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
while the best surface of all, which is like
marble or ivory to work on, a surface
which may be rubbed or scratched without
harm, is the old mounted thin Whatman
or Bank Note paper prepared by Messrs.
Roberson and Newman. These thin papers
are mounted on heavy boards and kept
under hydraulic pressure for weeks, until
the whole becomes a solid mass. This
mounted Whatman, when well made, is
the best paper in the world; it is also
the most expensive. Thin foreign correspondence
paper may also be used, putting
it over the sketch like tracing paper, and
when the drawing is finished mounting it
on card board; tracing paper may also be
mounted. One scheme not much in vogue
yet is to draw upon black paper with
Chinese white, making the drawing in white
lines instead of black. Any sort of writing
paper, or all varieties of rough or smooth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Whatman are useful. Of course in drawing
on rough paper you are bound to get a rough
broken result in printing; however, if you
know what you are after, no one will object
but the engraver. In fact any sort of
white paper may be used for pen and ink
work; only, the smooth gives the most
certain results. There are also many
grained papers which give a tint; that is,
a mechanical tint is printed on the paper,
lights are scratched in it, blacks are put
in with a pen or brush, another tint in
pencil or chalk is added, and many tricks
may be played, one usually only a little
less satisfactory than the other. These
papers are made by Gillott, of Paris, and
Anger and Goeschl, of Vienna, and generally
supplied by colourmen; they are
called Gillott or scratch papers.</p>

<p>There are also various clay or chalk
surfaced papers which, after being drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
upon, may be scratched to get light in the
design. The results are, however, rarely
satisfactory. In fact, it is best to use a
good handmade white paper; you will be
surer of your result, and that is what you
are working for.</p>

<p>Having given you a list of the necessary
materials, I will try to tell you how you
should use them. I shall not try to compel
you to make short lines or long lines,
black blots or white lines: work in your
own fashion, only that must be good, and
capable of being engraved and printed.
I shall not tell you how to draw, but
how to draw so that your work may reproduce
and print best. You may commence
your drawing in either one of two
ways, by making a pencil sketch on your
sheet of paper which is to be sent to the
engraver, preferably in blue pencil which
does not photograph, and in as few lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
as possible; or by commencing straight away
at your final work, in ink; if it is a drawing
from nature, I do not see why you should
not do this, for it will teach you care in
selecting your lines and putting them
down. And as you have an ink eraser in
metal and rubber you should be able to
remove those which are wrong.</p>

<p>But if your design is more in the nature
of a composition with elaborate figures, or
figures in action, it will be almost impossible
to do this. True, most interesting
sketches may be made, and should be made
and must be made direct from nature.
But your final design will in nearly every
case have to be built up from these.
Therefore, unless you can &ldquo;see the whole
thing in your head&rdquo; before you put it on
paper, so clearly that you only want a
model to keep you right, I think you had
better make sketch after sketch, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
transfer the best to the sheet on which it
is to be completed by putting transfer paper
under the sketch and tracing paper over
it. Probably you will pencil on the final
drawing, but do as little as you can, for
the camera, when the drawing comes to be
photographed, pays just as much attention
to smudges, finger marks, pencil lines, and
meaningless accidents as it does to those
portions which are brim full of meaning.
By neglecting these matters all artists give
engravers much trouble, and unless the
engraver is an artist too he not infrequently
bestows great pains on the reproduction
of an accidental line, even though
in order to do so he ruins the entire drawing.
And again, in all cheap work your
drawing is placed with a number of others
and no special attention is paid to it,
and it reproduces somehow, or don&rsquo;t, which
is much the same thing. But in case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
of failure you will be blamed by the
public.</p>

<p>The first thing to remember in putting
your drawing on the paper is the space it
is to fill; if it is to be a full page, it must
be made the size of that page or twice as
large; at any rate it must have some
definite relation to it. In the case of half
a page, it is only necessary that the top
or bottom of the drawing should fit across
the printed matter; still, the drawing should
not be made so high that it will not fit in,
or so narrow as to be ineffective, but if
you will look at any book or magazine you
will see what I mean.</p>

<p>Again, for cheap rapid work as little
cross-hatching as possible should be
indulged in, for all cross-hatched lozenges
become smaller lozenges in reduction, and
the smaller they are the easier it is for
them to fill up and clog with ink. Draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
your shadows with parallel lines whenever
you can without being mechanical; they
engrave and print well.</p>

<p>After several years&rsquo; experience I am
quite unable to say how much or how
little a drawing should be reduced, for
there is no reason why it should be drawn
the same size it is to be engraved, save
that the nearer it is the same size, the
nearer the result should be to the original;
if the reduction is to be great, it is easier
to make the design larger and have it
mechanically reduced. The excessive reduction
of a drawing tends to make the
lines run together into a black mass sometimes,
and the enlargement of a drawing&mdash;this,
too, may be done&mdash;makes the lines
at times look crude and clumsy. But it
is impossible to foretell results in any two
cases. Only there is one matter: a good
drawing in line will, with good engraving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
and printing, look well, whether the artist
knew anything of process or not. But
there are some things to be observed, if
certain results are wished for.</p>

<p>In simple cheap work the ink should
be uniformly black, for the engraved block
will be put with type, and inked with the
same amount and strength of colour all
over; therefore, in order to get variety,
distance, effect, you must use lines of
different widths, placed at varying distances
apart, not of different degrees of colour.
In theory at least, then, the foreground
should be drawn with a firm bold line,
the middle distance with a medium-sized
line, the lines themselves closer together,
and the extreme distance with a thin line.
But there is no rule, only get variety in
your line and this will produce variety and
interest in the engraved result.</p>

<p>If you make your drawings much larger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
than they are to be reproduced, you will
often be greatly surprised at the change
in their appearance. Greys will, by filling
up, become darker, and lights lighter owing
to the concentration around them of masses
of colour; that is, blacks become blacker,
and whites whiter in reproduction. But do
remember that though the drawings by Boyd
Houghton, Millais, F. Walker and Pinwell
were made the size you see them, on the
wood, in the books of twenty-five years
ago, the drawings made to-day by Abbey,
for example, are four or five times as large
as the published engravings, and are not,
in the originals, filled with that microscopic
work which appears in the reproductions.
But do not make crude lines under the
impression that they will ever be anything
but crude. Try to make a beautiful drawing,
a beautiful line&mdash;unless you can do this
you will never get a beautiful reproduction;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
and once you have learned to draw, study
the best books and the best magazines,
always remembering that drawings to-day
are made much larger, as a rule, than you
see them on the printed page.</p>

<p>Again, in reproduction you will often
find that some parts of the same drawing
change more than others; some places, for
example, become too weak, others too
strong. I cannot explain this, but you will
find that it does happen. At times it
may be because the photograph is bad,
or the etching is rotten, but even with
good photography and etching the final
result is often disappointing.</p>

<p>In pen work you may run the gamut
from solid blacks to the most delicate
grey line. Do not try to always, but
select a colour scheme which is restrained
and appropriate to every drawing.</p>

<p>Solid black will reproduce best because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
it is a solid mass, excepting in cheap rapid
printing, when solid blacks either get too
much or too little ink. A number of
black lines close together will reproduce
almost equally well, because in engraving
and printing these lines support the paper
and do not take up too much ink. A
single thin line, on the contrary, always
thickens in the engraving, and often prints
badly because in the printing press the
ink and paper bear down too heavily
upon it and it receives too much ink and
thickens up.</p>

<p>I have recommended you to use only
black ink and white paper; before you
have worked much you will try experiments,
I am sure, in greying ink, putting
water with it, and leaving pencil marks,
or adding lines with lithographic chalk, or
crayon; but you will find out the moment
the drawing is printed that everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
comes quite black, and if you have made
your distance in broad grey lines it will
possibly ruin your whole scheme. Greys
may be obtained by engraving the blocks
by hand, rouletting, or a number of other
ways which I shall explain. Line drawings
may also be made altogether in
pencil, on rough paper, in chalk or
crayon, reinforced, if necessary, with a blot
of ink, or a wash, or a line with a pen here
and there; but for line work with these
materials you must employ a grained paper
in order to get a proper mechanical direct
reproduction of the work. Bristol boards
must not be used. Sometimes these combinations
of pen and pencil work are excellent;
but they must harmonise, otherwise
the result is unpleasant.</p>

<p>Some idea of the effect your drawing
will present when engraved may be
obtained by the use of a diminishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
glass; and, <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, you might study
some of the engravings in the books and
magazines around you with a magnifying
glass.</p>

<p>Corrections in line drawings with pen
should be made either with an ink eraser,
a razor, the razor knife, or by painting
over the place with Chinese white, or, if
it be large, by pasting down a bit of
paper on it. This is the most usual way;
if the paper is thin and the edges well
joined, it is the best. Or you may cut a
hole from the back and let in a bit of
paper, paring down the edges, or scraping
them down; but be careful about the
edges, because they make a nasty line
when the drawing is photographed. In
pencil, crayon, or charcoal work, remove
imperfections in the ordinary way with a bit
of rubber. You will not, of course, lose your
head and elaborate a pen drawing, any more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
than you would a chalk or charcoal drawing
or etching. You will select your lines
with the utmost care, put them down with
the greatest intelligence, and the more
care and intelligence you exercise the
better will be your illustrations; however,
this is what you are trying to do every
time you make a drawing in line from
life or the antique, and I will not bore
you by repeating what you hear every
day in your ordinary school work, nor
will I do more than remind you how
careful you must be in your composition,
in your arrangement of lines, in your
placing of blacks, in making up your
picture; only exercise the judgment necessary
to compose any other work of art.</p>

<p>Your drawings should be works of
art; be proud of them; but also regard
them as a means to an end, and, as I
have said, for cheap and rapid printing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
draw on smooth white paper with good
black ink, and do not use big solid
blacks, or single thin lines. Keep your
work as open as possible and do not
have it reduced. That is, draw as near
the size it is to appear (if you can find
that out) as possible. For the best engraving
and printing, draw as you like.
Anything to-day can be photographed and
engraved; the great difficulty is in the
printing. Remember that if you do not
put distinction and character into your
work, the engraver and printer cannot.
They will take much away in any case.</p>

<p>As you are working for an editor, you
will have to please him. Do so if you
can without hurting your work and your
own standard of right and wrong.</p>

<p>But always work in your own way, if
that is at all possible for reproduction
and printing, if not, you will have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
change your methods. For you are
working for a definite purpose, illustration;
therefore your work must engrave.</p>

<p>If you wish to succeed you must see
all the illustration you can, you must talk
to editors and illustrators, and you must
go down into the printing office and the
engraver&rsquo;s shop.</p>

<p>You must learn your trade, for if you
have not passed through the drudgery of
the apprentice, you will never become a
master of your craft.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S illustrators, or would-be illustrators,
your work is not at an end with
the completion of your drawings; you
must look after them while they are
being engraved, and you should see them
through the press. From the time you
are given a commission to illustrate a
subject until the printed result is in the
hands of the public, the work in all its
stages should be the object of your untiring
attention. It is true that at present
the fact that you take an interest in
your profession will be counted against
you in some quarters, for should you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
happen&mdash;as is not unlikely&mdash;to know more
of drawing, engraving, and printing than
the art editor, the engraver, or the
printer, your suggestions will not be received
with enthusiasm, nor your criticisms
with delight. Suggestions mean
changes, and criticism means objections
to the routine way of doing things. Then
you may not feel a great interest in the
scientific side of your work, yet chemistry
plays an important part in illustration.
The mechanical reproduction of drawings
is based entirely on chemical action, and
you must know something of this matter if
you would get good results.</p>

<p>But let us consider the whole subject.
Drawings in line were originally, in the
fifteenth century, reproduced by wood
cutting;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that is to say, the drawing was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
made in line with pen, point, or brush on
the side of a plank, and all those portions
of the block which were not drawn upon
were cut away with knives and chisels,
the design only remaining in relief; this
relief was dabbed over with ink or paint,
and a piece of damp paper was laid on it.
The back of this paper was rubbed, burnished,
or pressed on to the inked surface
of the block and took up the ink from
it; on removing the paper an impression
in reverse of the inked block was found
on the under side of it. And this was the
method, with improvements, employed in
printing from type, for three hundred
years.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a></span>
Of course I shall refer to metal engraving in
another lecture.</p>
</div>

<p>About the beginning of this century the
design began to be drawn upon the end
of a block of box-wood&mdash;a cross section of
it&mdash;and the parts left blank were cut
away with gravers, tools used by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
engravers in metal, or else lines were engraved
on the surface of the block, which printed as
whites in the blacks; the grain of the cross
section of box-wood was firmer and finer,
and with the gravers more delicate lines
could be engraved and more true results
obtained; and at the same time continual
improvements were being made in the
presses, steam being substituted for hand
power, and the manufacture of paper and
ink totally revolutionised.</p>

<p>These methods were employed until
about 1865, when, instead of the drawings
being made by the artists on the block
of wood, they began to be drawn on paper
in line, and then photographed on to the
wood. This was a great improvement,
because the artist could now make his
designs of any size he wished and have
them photographed down to the required
dimensions and reversed for him: the mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
reversing in many cases was both tedious
and uninteresting.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
If the drawing is a portrait of a place, it must
be reversed on the wood or metal in order that the
print may appear as the original does in nature.</p>
</div>

<p>The final step which brings us to the
present, though not by any means, I am
sure, to the end of the chapter, is the
superseding of the woodcutter or wood engraver
in line, by the mechanical engraver
in metal or gelatine.</p>

<p>Now you may do your drawings, if you
wish, in line with a pencil or brush upon
the prepared piece of box-wood, and the
engraver may cut away all those portions
of the wood-block which you have not
touched, remembering always that though
you draw freely he must engrave laboriously,
and the more free your drawing
becomes, the more complicated must his
engraving be. So when you make a
sketchy drawing on wood, none but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
most accomplished engraver can retain
that look of freedom and sketchiness; if
the lines of the drawing become really
complicated, in cross hatching, for example,
he cannot follow them, he must suggest
them. Hence, unless the engraver really
loves this sort of work, it is but drudgery,
and the better the reproduction the more
skilled labour wasted.</p>

<p>Now photography has changed all this.
A photograph of the drawing, of the required
size it is to appear on the printed
page, is taken. The drawing may be enlarged
or reduced to this size, and the
negative thus obtained is placed in reverse
in a photographic printing frame, in contact
with a sensitised zinc plate, coated
with a thin film either of albumen or
bitumen, or it may be that a gelatine
film is the material used for printing on.
In the first method the albumen coated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
piece of zinc is removed from the printing
frame as soon as the photographic print has
been made; it is then coated with ink
and placed in water, the albumen and ink
upon it adhere to those parts of the zinc
which have been exposed to light, and
may be washed off the other parts, thus
leaving the picture on the zinc in ink.
By the bitumen process the picture is
printed in the same way: the plate is
placed in a bath of turpentine, the picture
appears on the zinc, and the bitumen
dissolves off the other parts.</p>

<p>If these two prints are now covered with
powdered rosin, gum, and ink, they may be
placed in a bath of nitric acid and water, and
the exposed parts bitten or etched away.
This is a most interesting and delicate process,
and success depends in good work more
upon the skill and artistic intelligence of
the etcher than the chemicals used. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
object is to remove all the whites as in wood
engraving, half remove the greys, and leave
the blacks. After the zinc has been bitten
a short time it is taken out of the bath again,
covered with gum, resin and ink to protect it
from the acid, heated, when the protecting
mass melts and runs down the sides of the
bitten lines and protects them also; this process
is continued until the block is sufficiently
etched. When the exposed parts are all
eaten away the picture appears in relief.
This occupies a few hours, maybe but an
hour or less. When completed, the zinc
picture is mounted upon a piece of wood, to
make it the same height as the type, placed
in a printing press and copies are made of
it, or from electrotypes or stereotypes, at
the rate of from twenty to 20,000 an hour.
This is, I hope, an intelligible outline of the
photo-engraving process; every mechanical
engraver has some variation which is his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
carefully guarded secret. The blocks may
be of zinc or copper or other metal, and all
sorts of chemicals are used. But I cannot
too strongly impress upon you that good
work in mechanical engraving is only to be
obtained by artistic workmen; still, remarkable
results are to be seen all about, even in
the cheapest prints. But the very best process
engravings are produced only by men
who are artists and care for each block. In
the case of the best engravers they will
know better than you which process to use,
and there is no more necessity for you to try
to tell a mechanical engraver how the work
is to be done, than for you to tell a wood
engraver what tools he shall work with.
Bad drawings may look better by one process
than another, and good illustrations may
be spoiled more by one method than another.
But every intelligent engraver will try again
and again until he gets the best result he can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
The gelatine process consists in printing
the picture on a sensitised film of gelatine.
Now if this gelatine is soaked in water the
parts representing the whites swell, and the
darks, really the picture, remain as they were,
as the light has rendered them insensible to
water; from this swelled gelatine mould a
cast in plaster of Paris can be taken, from
this a wax mould is made, and finally an
electrotype. The process is only used, I
believe, by one firm; the results are good,
but no better than the others.</p>

<p>Let us consider for a moment what are
the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical
reproduction. The first advantage
is rapidity of production&mdash;a facsimile wood
engraving may take weeks to produce, a
mechanical engraving takes a day or so;
this is not an artistic but a commercial
gain. The wood engraving loses, the more
intricate and complicated and close the details
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
become; the mechanical or process engraving
not infrequently gains.</p>

<p>The wood engraver may make mistakes
in cutting the lines in the wood block, but if
the lines are properly put down, the camera
and the process engraver should not; and if
they do, much less time is lost and labour
wasted than with wood engravings.</p>

<p>Mechanical engraving is a much less costly
method. These are not any of them very
artistic reasons, but they count with publishers,
and they count with you. But the
great artistic advantage is that the artist
may make his drawing of any size he wishes;
it is not cut to pieces but preserved, and if
it is properly drawn, as I have explained to
you, it should produce in complicated work
a more faithful result. In simple line work
it is almost impossible to tell a wood engraving
from a process block.</p>

<p>The drawbacks are that the line is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
sometimes too faithfully copied&mdash;that the engraving
is shallow, and that the wood yields a
richer, fatter effect than any metal, mechanical
block.</p>

<p>These are artistic drawbacks, but they may
all be overcome by the artist. The line, if
good, cannot be too faithfully copied; the
engraving, if shallow, can be made deeper,
engraved anew by the wood engraver. The
fat line so much prized was made with a
brush, and, as I have said, brush work reproduces
perfectly. And in the majority of
cases the original wood or process blocks
are never printed from, but casts of them
called stereotypes or electrotypes are used;
therefore the fat line of the wood is more
or less the product of the imagination. I
do not mean to say the original wood or
metal block will not give a richer impression
than any cast from it, but I do say it is only
in the case of proofs that the original is used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
If a pencil or other drawing in line is to be
reproduced, in which the varying colour of
the pencil mark is to be retained, its greyness
for example, or if the pen line is very
delicate, or there are many single unsupported
lines in the drawing, another method
must be employed. A microscopically ruled
glass screen, ruled with fine lines made with a
diamond and filled in with ink, is placed in
the camera in front of the glass plate on
which the picture is to be photographed.
There are various ways in which this is
done, with the object of breaking up into
line the tones which would otherwise print
perfectly black, or, of supporting those weak
lines which would print too heavily. This
negative thus obtained is printed on to the
zinc or copper plate, is then etched much as
in the case of the simple line block. This
process, usually called half-tone, was invented
for reproducing wash, but is much used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
now for line, especially when the dots or line
of the screen are cut away by the wood
engraver in the whites. The photo engraver
is now endeavouring so to shift or adjust his
screen that the dots will come only where
they are wanted to break up the solid black,
and some most interesting results have been
obtained. When I am describing the reproduction
of wash drawings, I shall return to
this subject.</p>

<p>Spaces of tint on line drawings can be and
almost always are obtained by the use of
what is known as shading mediums; that is,
pieces of gelatine or copper with lines or dots
engraved in them are filled with printer&rsquo;s ink,
and these lines or dots are transferred by the
engraver to the parts of the picture on the
zinc plate where they are wanted before the
plate is etched. There are many ways in
which the artist can get the same effect by
inking bits of silk and pressing them on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
drawing, by inking his thumb, or by drawing
with a pencil or chalk or even pen over a
rough book-cover, the only object is to get a
bit of tone in a line drawing: in cheap work
it is often very effective, in the best work it is
usually out of place. All the artist need do is
indicate the spot, or the outlines of the parts
where the tint is wanted, by a blue pencil.
If the engraver knows how the block is to be
printed he will use the tint that will print
best. They are all useful, but not very sympathetic.</p>

<p>Photo-Lithography and kindred methods
are either of little importance or will be referred
to under Lithography. Finally, if the
lines are too black or too strong they can be
cut away or thinned, or darks opened up by
the engraver, just as on a wood block; or a
little wheel in a handle called a roulette may
be run over parts of the engraving which are
too heavy&mdash;the teeth of the wheel break the
lines into dots and lighten them.</p>

<br />
<span class="lecture">THE MAKING OF WASH DRAWINGS AND
THEIR REPRODUCTION BY MECHANICAL
PROCESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN I speak of wash drawings, I
would really refer to all painting or
drawing, in colour or monochrome, in tone,
as distinguished from work in line, which was
the subject of my last lecture.</p>

<p>Many persons do not like line work, never
master it, and are insensible to its beauty
when they see it. For these there is another
method of expression, although, I cannot
repeat too often, an illustrator should be able
to work in more ways than one. One may
make one&rsquo;s illustration in colour in oil, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
gouache, in body colour, in wash; in fact paint
a picture in the usual way, though, even with
the best and most careful methods of reproduction,
it will be almost invariably found
that in the various stages of photographing,
etching and printing, very much, if not all,
the charm has disappeared, even though the
result be printed in colour, for up to the
present no colour can be perfectly reproduced,
or rendered into black and white,
even by the best engraver in the world.
And no colour can be reproduced except
by the artist himself. A few men like
Detaille, De Neuville, and Lynch have, I
believe, invented a special colour scheme
for the requirements of colour reproduction,
and some of the engravings made from their
pictures by Messrs. Boussod, Valladon &amp; Co.
are very wonderful; but in the best examples
I imagine there is an enormous amount of
careful touching up and going over by hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
which places these reproductions in the
category of proofs rather than of prints.
Certainly there is a vast difference between
them and the colour work usually seen in the
same firm&rsquo;s commercial publications, good as
they are, and there is a yawning gulf between
these and the colour print we have with us
always. Therefore, if you wish to work in
oil I would suggest that you work in monochrome,
and further I would advise you to
make your designs in simple black and white&mdash;that
is if the reproduction is to be printed
with black ink; for the nearer your original
is to the colour in which it is to be printed,
the nearer will the engraver and printer be
able to approach it. I would also suggest
that perfectly dead colours should be used,
because varnish or any sort of glaze, shine
or glitter, will tell in the photograph, and
even the most careful engravers are rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
given to reproducing the photographic copy
than the original, even though the latter be
at their side.</p>

<p>One method, that has been successful lately,
is mixing oil colour with turpentine until it
flows like water, and then working on paper;
this reproduces most excellently, the only
drawback being that the colour rubs off
easily.</p>

<p>Body colour and gouache are much used;
the only thing to be remembered is that you
should keep to the same colours and the
same method of work all the way through
each drawing. It is very interesting to
combine body colour with wash; often in
the original design the combination is most
pleasing, but the camera does not approve
of it, and frequently plays the most unexpected
tricks with these combinations.
Therefore, either stick to body colour, lamp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
black, ivory black and white,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or pure wash; in
the latter case there is nothing which photographs
so well as charcoal grey, made by
Newman &amp; Co. The most delicate washes
reproduce beautifully. It is rather hard to
manage, but once you can manage it, it is
almost perfect. It is best for work in a very
light key, in the extreme darks it is liable to
get heavy and sombre and gritty; and if you
want a positive black it is well to put it in
with ink or some stronger black, even at the
risk of knocking things rather out of tone.
The only objection to charcoal grey is that it
is rather difficult to work over it. Still, in
illustration in wash you will always get a
cleaner, sharper effect by doing your drawing
at once, getting your effect right with the first
wash, than by any amount of tinkering at it.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a></span>
Winsor &amp; Newton and Reeves have lately
been experimenting in this way, and their Albanine
and Process black are well spoken of by photo
engravers.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
In this pure wash work you should be
careful, very careful, not to let any meaningless
pencil lines show through, as they always
photograph, cannot be taken out, and at times
spoil the whole effect; in fact, imperfections in
wash drawings always reproduce more perfectly
than the perfections themselves, and it
is well to keep your paper reasonably clean,
to avoid smudging, blots and lines, or otherwise
you will be disappointed in the result.
It is often very effective in an original drawing
to put in a lot of colour, but it nearly always
comes out wrongly in the reproduction. On
the other hand, although body colour often
comes badly with wash, if you work over or
into either your wash or body colour with
pen, chalk, or pencil of the same substance
as the wash, the result is harmonious often
and excellent. I mean, if you make a drawing
in wash with Indian ink and work on it
with liquid Indian ink in a pen, the result will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
be right. If you touch up charcoal grey with
charcoal, the wash and line unite&mdash;these
things, however, you will soon learn by experience,
even though that experience is
gained in a rather painful manner. Still, at
present the better magazines and papers are
not a practising ground for students, as they
were some time ago, and you must be able
to do good work before you can expect any
intelligent editor to print it.</p>

<p>Drawings or paintings&mdash;in fact all work in
tone is reproduced mechanically by what is
known as the half-tone process, which I
referred to briefly in my last lecture.</p>

<p>The drawing is photographed, but in front
of the sensitised glass, a microscopically ruled
screen is placed to break up this tone into
dots or lines, really to get the same effect as
the wood engraver obtains with his dots and
lines. Otherwise, the tones being flat, or
even if they are gradated, would print as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
a black mass; but these screens break up the
masses into little squares, which receive the
printing ink on their faces, and the colour or
original effect of the picture is thus preserved.
It is rather difficult to explain this,
but the screen produces white lines in the
darks and dark lines in the whites; you can
see them by looking at any block. Afterwards,
the process is exactly the same as for
line drawings. This reproduction of wash
work is very uncertain; good effects are obtained,
about as often as failures. The
delicate tones are not infrequently altogether
lost. There are no positive blacks or whites,
but a uniform grey tint covers the entire
block, in which all delicacy is often hidden.
Therefore, to get a good effect, when
printed, the drawing should be simply made,
that is if it is for cheap engraving and
rapid printing; but if for the best books
and magazines, wood engravers may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
employed to remedy the imperfections of the
photograph and the mistakes of the etcher.
That is, whites may be cut, blacks toned
down, lines thinned, or large spaces on the
block may be left for the engraver to work
upon: most remarkable results may be seen
in the better American magazines.</p>

<p>There are many qualities in a drawing
which that senseless machine, the camera,
will never reproduce. There are also a few
points which it is very difficult (in tone work)
for an engraver to render, but they may both
combine and obtain most interesting effects.</p>

<p>For instance, it is very difficult to give in
a wood engraving the look of paint on
canvas, without losing much of the picture
itself, for if the wood engraver begins to try
to imitate texture he not infrequently loses
the subject. The mechanical process seems
to do this very easily, especially if the
brush marks on the canvas are at all prominent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
But the delicacy is frequently lost; so,
too, are the strong blacks, though a good
wood engraver can remedy these defects by
treating the metal block just as though it
was wood, engraving on it, cutting out, save
where it is right, all the mechanical look.
But two factors are necessary, first a good
engraver, and, second, a publisher who is
willing to pay for this engraving, which is
expensive. The majority of publishers will
not do so, though they will pay for the
work of a good or notorious author. They
will employ a feeble artist, a poor engraver,
and a cheap printer, and talk of how much
better the work was done thirty years ago.
Of course it was; it was decently drawn and
mostly badly engraved, vilely printed, but well
paid for; now the photograph is the standard
and the results are all about us; therefore
you must think of the results. So make broad
simple masses, keep your work as flat as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
can, remembering that all blacks will have
the little white dots of the screen more or
less showing through them&mdash;these can be
kept out by the engraver, but they certainly
will appear in the cheapest work; remembering
that all delicate grey tones will be eaten
up by the screen, therefore don&rsquo;t put them
in if you can help it; and, finally, that unless
whites are cut out they will never appear,
instead you will have a dotted grey effect.</p>

<p>In the very near future many of these
imperfections will disappear, for you must
remember that it is scarcely ten years since
half tone began to be used at all. But look,
whenever you see them&mdash;and they are everywhere&mdash;at
the reproductions of half-tone
work; try and study out how the artist got
his effect; go to the art editor who published
the drawing and ask to see the original.
Talk with artists who do good work in black
and white; they are mostly human, intelligent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
and willing to help and advise you. Go to
the engravers&rsquo; shops and find out what the
engraver will tell you, and to printing offices
and see your work on the press.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the reproductions
of line drawings by the half-tone process.
One is sometimes tempted to wish that
all line work could be reproduced by half
tone and tone work could be reproduced by
line, because if the line is delicate or the
drawing is thin, the screen over it gives a
tint which is pleasing, at times makes it look
like an etching somewhat, especially if the
tint be judiciously cut out. You might
look at some of C.&nbsp;D. Gibson&rsquo;s work, where
very great delicacy has been obtained in
this way. Engravers are now endeavouring
to get the tint just where it is wanted, and
I have no doubt they will succeed. When
they do, photo-engraving by the half-tone
process will be greatly improved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
Finally, study the requirements of the
process not only as artists, but from the
point of view of the engraver; go down to
his shop and find out how the work is
done; make him show and tell you; insist
on seeing proofs of your drawings&mdash;good
proofs, too; make corrections on them, first
learning what corrections can be made. You
cannot have blacks put in your engravings
if they did not exist in the drawings, and,
roughly speaking, you can only tone down,
not strengthen any engraving; but you will
find, save in cases of blacks, it is only toning
down that the engraving wants, thinning and
greying of lines.</p>

<p>All this, I have no doubt, is very dry and
uninteresting and tedious, but unless you get
these things into your heads in the beginning,
your drawings will not photograph well, engrave
well, or print well; and if they don&rsquo;t,
you will not get any illustration to do, and
you may have yourselves to blame for it.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>OOD engraving, as a fine art, has
been virtually invented, developed,
brought to apparent perfection, and yet ceased
to exist, temporarily, almost, as a trade, in
this century.</p>

<p>A wood engraving is an engraving made
with a graver, upon a cross section of box-wood,
that is upon the end, and not the side,
of a plank, in relief. As in the case of
mechanical engraving, all the wood, excepting
that underneath the design upon the
block, is cut away, and the picture remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
alone in relief, raised upon the surface of the
block of the same height as the type; thus
the block may be placed on the press and
printed with the type.</p>

<p>The first great wood engraver was Thos.
Bewick, and he, unlike many of his followers
to-day, was an artist, and mostly made his
own drawings on the block and cut them as
he wished. He saw that wood engraving
was a substitute for the slower, more tedious,
and more expensive method of steel engraving;
that, most important, many of the
qualities of steel could be imitated in wood,
as the same tools were used; that it could be
printed with type; and, save that the richness
of colour could not be retained, that it had
most of the advantages of metal and few of
its disadvantages, and was vastly cheaper.
From the first, the imitation of steel was
considered the proper aim, and though early
in this century Stothard drew with a pen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
upon the block, and his designs were facsimiled
in the wood by Clennell, the prevailing
fashion was the imitation of steel
engraving, even by Bewick himself. Many
of his lines are exactly those used by the
steel engravers. By the middle of the
century steel engraving virtually disappeared,
its practitioners being unable to compete with
wood engravers. There have been but few
original engravers in this form of art, and
though the work of some of the steel
engravers who reproduced Turner and
Roberts, Wilkie and Landseer, is marvellous,
the art is almost dead at present.
Cheapness has killed it. Wood engraving
also killed lithography&mdash;a lithograph cannot
be printed with type&mdash;and consequently the
wood engraver became a most important
person. He ran a shop with many assistants;
he commissioned artists to make drawings
for his assistants to engrave, he dictated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
the way in which these drawings were to be
done, the way in which the lines were to be
drawn and washes made, so that they could
be cut most easily. He commissioned
writers to work up or down to the artists;
he printed the books and sold them to the
publishers, who were content to put their
names on the title pages. And by this
method much good and more bad work
was accomplished, but the engraver finally
became supreme, autocratic, dictatorial, insufferable;
and then he vanished, as a shop.
Process stepped in, in its turn, on account of
its cheapness; and to-day, unless the engraver
is an artist, he is but the slave of the process
man, a hard fate&mdash;but his own. Before
the introduction of photography, artists had
to make their designs for the wood engraver
the size they were wanted upon the block of
wood, if portraits of places, reverse them, in
pen, brush, pencil, or wash; the engraver cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
around and through these designs, making
a translation of them in relief on the block
which could be printed from. But the
drawing had disappeared, and the artist
had nothing but the engraving to show for
it, hence endless difficulties arose; good
artists hated to have their drawings cut to
pieces; good engravers hated to have their
work criticised unfavourably; also, drawing
of a small size, and in reverse on the block
was difficult to learn, and only a mechanical
craft of no artistic advantage when
learned. Therefore, as soon as it was
possible to escape from the drudgery, to
draw of any size on paper and have that
drawing photographed on to a sensitised
wood block, of the size it was wanted, in
reverse, all artists took to it. And a new
school of engravers arose, men who tried
to invent new methods of engraving so that
they could express the medium, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
the subject, in which a picture was produced.
True from Stothard onward, through Meissonier
and Menzel, engravers had tried to
render pen and pencil drawings in line on
wood; now everything began to be attempted,
charcoal, etchings, steel, water colours, lithographs,
oils. All the imperfections, accidents,
and blemishes were preserved, even
if the picture disappeared. But a number of
most distinguished artist wood engravers
appeared, especially in America, though few
of them learned their trade in that country.
But they received more encouragement,
better pay, better printing, and better artists
worked for them. And so the school of
American wood engravers, many of whom
are not Americans, was born.</p>

<p>Now how is the modern work done?
The artist&rsquo;s picture in any medium, of any
size, is given to the photographer, who
copies and reverses it, prints it on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
block of wood which has been sensitised
for that purpose. The print is usually not
very good, that is, it is darker, with many
of the qualities of the drawing lost; but it
serves only as a guide or a tracing for the
engraver, who takes his tools, and with
the drawing behind him, reflected in a
mirror to reverse it, proceeds to cut the
photograph of the drawing into relief, at
the same time trying to preserve the look
of the canvas, paper, or metal on which
it was made, and the feeling of the colour,
wash, or paint with which it was executed.
All this is most difficult, but a most artistic
result may be obtained, and one has but
to refer to the magazines of America and
some of the weekly papers of Germany,
France, and Spain, for a proof of it.</p>

<p>Here, though much good wood engraving
has been printed, outside the offices
of Messrs. Macmillan, Cassell and Co.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
and the <i>Graphic</i>, it has of late years been
mostly in the form of copies, electrotypes,
clich&eacute;s from foreign blocks which are supplied
by their makers, all over the world,
at a very low price, because they are not
reserved for any one paper or book. And
when you begin to see a man&rsquo;s painting,
or drawing, or engraving in every paper,
you begin to tire of him and his work.
The editors of papers which publish clich&eacute;s
seem to be the only people who like the
multiplication and cheapening of art, but
then there is no accounting for their tastes.
The tools and appliances for making wood
engravings are simple enough, but to engrave
anything but <i>facsimile</i> work, or your own
designs, will necessitate your going through
considerable practical training; probably some
years of apprenticeship.</p>

<p>To cut line drawings on the wood, or to
cut designs in large simple masses, you do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
not require so much practice. All the tools
you need are different sized gravers and
gouges, a small chisel to cut large spaces,
an engraver&rsquo;s rest for the block, so that it
can be turned freely and easily about,
and a whetstone to sharpen your tools.</p>

<p>Lamps and globes for water, shades for
your eyes, you will scarcely need, but a
magnifying glass, something like that which
watchmakers use, may be useful. With these
simple tools and some box-wood&mdash;they can
all be bought in East Harding Street or at
any colour maker&rsquo;s&mdash;you have the necessary
appliances.</p>

<p>If you draw on the block, a slight wash
of Chinese white will help to make it work
easily. Draw with a brush or pencil; or if
in wash, without body colour, as that will
chip off. You have only to remember that
the block, either plain or with the drawing
on it, would print perfectly black, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
every line you make with the graver in the
surface of it, will print white. Therefore, as
I have said, to get an outline engraving, you
simply cut away everything but the drawing,
which is left in relief on the surface of the
block, and which alone prints, the rest of it
being cut away. It is not necessary to
engrave the surface very deeply, only so
much that neither the ink nor the paper will
touch in the hollows between the lines or
masses. Mistakes are not easy to remedy,
except by making a hole in the block and
inserting a plug of wood, and then engraving
that afresh.</p>

<p>The art of engraving in <i>facsimile</i>, that
is, of engraving around lines made with
pen, or brush, or pencil, is comparatively
easy, it only requires much training and
a steady hand. But the ability to translate
a work in colour into black and
white, on a wood block, so that it shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
give a good idea of the original, is far
more difficult. To do it well, the engraver
must not only have the knowledge
of the technical requirements of his craft
at his finger ends, only to be gained after
years of apprenticeship, but he must be a
trained artist as well. If he wishes to get
the best results, he must have the original
before him, he must understand it and
appreciate it. And finally, he must have
the technical skill to engrave it. Even
then, most likely, the artist will not like
the block. It is a difficult art, a thankless
art, save in the rarest cases: one which
requires years of special training, and at
present in this country, no matter how
great an artist one is, there is very little
chance to practise it. Work of this sort
you cannot expect to be able to do without
years of training; if you care for it you
must apprentice yourself to a wood engraver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
Still there are forms of wood engraving
which you may take up, from the most
primitive to the most complicated, and you
may carry out the work from the designing
of it to the printing of it yourselves, or, you
may draw on the block and cut away, as
in engravings by the late R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson
(or were they done by Lloyd Osbourne or
some other ghost?), and possibly you will
have an experience like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;A blemish in the cut appears,<br /></div>
<div class="i0">Alas, it cost both blood and tears.<br /></div>
<div class="i0">The glancing graver swerved aside,<br /></div>

<div class="i0">And now the apologetic bard<br /></div>
<div class="i0">Demands indulgence for his pard.&rdquo;<br /></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or I imagine without much trouble you
might invent something in the style of
Valloton, a Frenchman, who is resurrecting
wood cutting in a manner of his own, while
carrying on the traditions of the old men. I
hope you may be able to get as much life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
and go in it as he has. Make your drawing
on the wood, or on paper, have it photographed
on the wood in the latter case,
and cut around the lines, leaving only the
drawing. The greatest difficulty is with fine
lines, and you see how cleverly Valloton
has avoided making them. Or, like Lep&egrave;re,
another French artist&mdash;he would be a man
to study with&mdash;do big, bold, effective things;
or again you might attempt, as he does,
colour work on wood, like that done by
the Japanese, drawing it, engraving it, and
printing it all yourselves.</p>

<p>Or, take up drawing and engraving
in the manner of Caldecott, Crane, or
Kate Greenaway, when they were reproduced
and printed by Edmund Evans.</p>

<p>Process is fighting for colour too, but
wood, at least in proofs, and that is all
you would care for, gives some qualities
far beyond process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
In colour printing from wood blocks as
many blocks must be made as there are
colours, and there must be as many
separate printings made from these blocks
as there are colours in the printed picture.
There must also be an outline block called
the key block. Usually in European
colour printing, whether from wood blocks,
or by lithography, or even process, the
colours are printed on top of each other;
for example, a blue is printed over a
yellow to get green, and at times several
colours are superimposed, with the result
that colour is lost and mud obtained. The
Japanese have shown us how to make
colour prints, however, and their method
is now adopted by all intelligent colour
printers. It consists in making the right
colour before it is put on the block, and
in placing the colours side by side like a
mosaic. The work is done somewhat in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
this way; the artist makes his drawing,
several tracings (as many as there are
colours) are made from it, and one extra
tracing must be made of the outline only.
Or rather the outline alone is cut on the
block, other blocks are then made for each
colour, or the parts cut out of the same
block; one will contain all the red, another
all the blue, a third the yellow, and so on.
They must be very accurately cut, so as to
fit together and print truly, and you can
see from Japanese prints how wonderfully
well the work is done. Of course the
editions from such blocks are very limited,
and on this account, like etchings, often
vary, the printers having tried experiments
in colour. The grain of the wood is taken
advantage of in printing, as it often gives
a lovely pattern; a good printer will wash
in gradated skies with the backgrounds,
and no matter how wonderfully they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
worked, if of the same colour, are printed
usually from the same block. The
Japanese, I believe, use water-colours;
certainly the French and English, who
have tried to imitate them, do, putting the
colour, mixed with a little size or gum, on
the face of the block with a sponge; in
fact they are printed water-colours. Several
Frenchmen have obtained in this way
most notable results. Very similar was
the fashion of colour printing called chiaroscuro,
used in the early part of the century.
The trouble with this was that the oil
with which the inks were mixed, either
ran, or spoiled the pages, or did not dry
well. Drawings on grey paper in chalk
can be wonderfully imitated in this way,
and there are methods of using steel and
copper plates, bitten into relief to get outlines
or tints, which were also employed.
To-day in the printing of wood engravings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
and process blocks by steam, at many
thousands an hour, the same system of
colour printing, by placing the colours side
by side, is being attempted, for it is impossible
to obtain fine tone or rich effect
by placing one colour on top of another,
even in slow printing by hand, while it is
absurd to attempt it rapidly by steam. In
the most successful attempts yet made,
those of the <i>Le Quotidien Illustr&eacute;</i> and <i>Le
Rire</i>, Paris papers, colour printing from
process blocks has been most successfully
done, and I do not doubt that in a very
few years colour printing in magazines and
newspapers will be very general.</p>

<p>As I have said, all intelligent printers
have now come to the conclusion that
simple flat colours, put on side by side,
will alone give good artistic results; they
have only learned this, however, after
going quite to the other extreme: after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
trying to get pure colour and rich effects
by using the three primary colours on top
of each other, they obtained but crudeness,
vulgarity, and mud.</p>

<p>Photography and chemistry are useful
in art, but art cannot be created by these
means. It may be that some one, some
day, will be able to photograph a picture
in colour, but there is as yet no evidence
of it.</p>

<p>Wood engravings may also be made by
scraping or lowering the fronts or backs
of blocks, and rich, soft, fat effects
can be produced. Very little has been
done, I think, with these lowered blocks,
some remarkable examples of which can
be seen in Chatto and Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;History
of Wood Engraving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Photography has aided the artist very
much in wood engraving (though most
engravers say it has not), and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
in colour printing it can be made great
use of; as, instead of tracing a design on
to several blocks, it can be photographed,
thus ensuring accuracy&mdash;though the Japanese
obtained this without any photographic aids&mdash;and
saving much time.</p>

<p>Still, that is about as far as it goes at
present, and photography will never supersede
art, though it is engaged in a famous
struggle with artlessness.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>LECTURE VII.<br />
<br />
<span class="lecture">LITHOGRAPHY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ITHOGRAPHY, for some time the
rival of metal engraving and even for
a time of wood, was invented at the end of
the last century, and, as its name implies, is
the art of drawing or writing upon stone.
Briefly, a peculiar grained stone, found in
Germany, may be drawn upon with greasy
chalk or ink; afterward it is slightly etched,
only washed really, with weak nitric acid and
water to fix the drawing and somewhat
reduce the surface of the stone; if the stone
be now covered with gum, allowed to dry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
and then inked, the ink adheres only to the
drawing; and if a sheet of paper is placed
on it, and the whole passed through a press,
a print, or rather the drawing in ink, will
come off on the paper. This is roughly the
art of lithography.</p>

<p>The most important consideration for you,
however, is the making of the drawing.
This may be done in one of two ways:
either upon the stone itself, or upon transfer
paper specially coated, so that the entire
drawing is transferred from the paper on
which it is drawn, by mechanical means, to
the stone, and not merely a print from the
original drawing. For many reasons it would
probably be best to draw upon the stone
itself always; because, first and above all,
the less intervention&mdash;even mechanical intervention&mdash;there
is between the artist and his
work, the better; and in many cases it is not
possible to get good results unless the artist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
works on the stone. But if one has to make
a large drawing out of doors, it is obviously
impossible to carry about a big and heavy
stone with one; therefore lithographic transfer
paper must be used if the work is to be
done from nature.</p>

<p>Before this paper was perfected (it is very
good now, and can be obtained from Hughes
&amp; Kimber of West Harding Street, though
Belfont&rsquo;s of Paris is the best), the artist either
copied his sketches, studies, or pictures himself,
on the stone, if he understood lithography;
or else his drawings were copied for
him by some other artists who were trained
lithographers. One most notable example of
this is to be found in J.&nbsp;F. Lewis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alhambra.&rdquo;
The originals by Lewis were
redrawn on the stone by J.&nbsp;D. Harding, J.
Lane, and W. Ganci, as well as by Lewis
himself; inevitably some of these men&rsquo;s
individuality was apparent, and even in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
case of Lewis, much must have been lost by
copying his own designs; and if original
work is given to professional lithographers,
in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred all
the real character is taken out of it. To-day,
however, one may draw upon transfer paper,
being careful only not to touch it with one&rsquo;s
fingers, either in lithographic chalk or lithographic
ink, which is only the chalk rubbed
down and put on with a pen or brush, on
this paper, which should be fastened down
like an oil sketch, in a box having a cover,
by drawing pins. Take the drawing to the
printer; he will put it on the stone and
print it for you far better than you can
do it yourself; still this is rather expensive,
as the transferring of the drawing to the
stone and pulling a few proofs will cost you
about a guinea. But if your design can be
drawn in your own studio, or at the lithographer&rsquo;s,
on the stone, it is not only much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
simpler, but the result may be better, and
you can employ more varied methods of
work. For example, you may draw with
the lithographic crayon&mdash;Lemercier&rsquo;s are
the best; get them at Lechertier &amp; Barbe&rsquo;s&mdash;just
as you would with ordinary chalk or
crayon. For if the stone is grained like
paper, the design, if well printed, should look
almost exactly like a drawing on paper. On
a smooth or ungrained stone you may draw
or write with pen or brush and lithographic
ink, which is only the crayon rubbed down
with gum arabic, or ammonia and water, as
you would rub down Indian ink, only you
must heat the saucer in which you are rubbing
it, a little. When you have done this,
use Gillott&rsquo;s lithographic pens, putting the ink
on the pen with a brush, or use a trimmed
sable brush brought to a fine point; you
must make your lines carefully, and get your
ink of the right consistency, otherwise it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
tends to blot and spread or smear. Again,
you may mix more of the medium with the
rubbed-down crayon. I should say it rubs,
when warm, without water; this medium
may be obtained ready mixed from Way &amp;
Sons, Wellington Street, Strand; paint with
it as you would in water colours, adding
more of the medium or more ink as you wish
little or much colour. I have tried only a
couple of experiments in this way, and they
were both complete failures. The trouble I
found was this: in making light tones, the
moment the brush charged with colour
touches the stone, the stone itself turns
much darker than the colour you are putting
on it; and as it dries out very slowly,
the making of a wash drawing is a most
tedious process, unless one has had enough
experience of the work to know just the
effect of the finished drawing, or rather just
the effect of the wash applied, which cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
be seen in its proper tone, while working
on the stone, since the appearance the stone
presents so long as it is wet is absolutely
different to what it will look like when dry,
and it is almost impossible to work over
washes, because the colour floats off if they
are gone over again, or at least smudges
and smears; still, corrections and additions
can be made with the crayon point, and the
whole design brought pretty well together.
The best work in wash has been done by
Lunois, a Frenchman. Corrections are at
all times difficult to make in lithographs, the
error having to be scratched out and the
stone repaired in that spot, before the new
work can be put in again.</p>

<p>Stump drawings may be made by getting
the crayon in powder and smearing it on the
stone in masses with a rag. Effects can be
obtained by removing too much colour with
ordinary scrapers and putting in modelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
with stumps and the point of the crayon;
or all three of the methods I have mentioned
may be combined, as they often are, on the
same stone, notably in the work of Hervier.</p>

<p>Tints may be obtained by stippling and
splatter work, as in pen drawings. There is
a machine called an air brush, used by
lithographers for this purpose, but the introduction
of mechanical dodges has done
much to harm lithography.</p>

<p>Zinc may be grained and drawn upon in
the same way; why this metal is not more
generally used, I do not know, for it is much
lighter, more portable, and can be easily
mounted on a plain stone to print from.</p>

<p>Until lately it was maintained that only
what was drawn on stone could be got off
it in a print. But Mr. Goulding, the etching
printer, who has been making a series of experiments,
says he can get almost as much
variety of effect, by wiping the surface of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
the stone carefully, in a small number of
prints, as he can from a copper plate (<i>see</i>
Lecture on <a href="#chap09">the printing of Etchings</a>). Still,
for you, the process ordinarily will end with
the drawing. Even the transferring is only
to be successfully done by skilled workmen,
and until you can print an etching decently,
it would be scarcely worth while to try a
lithograph.</p>

<p>Considering that the process is perfectly
autographic, that the materials are few and
cheap, it is strange that it is so little employed
at present. But a very serious
attempt is being made to revive it, and as
an artist like Mr. Whistler is the leader and
initiator, I believe it will be successful.</p>

<p>Colour printing by lithography, though
very complicated, might be tried by you;
as many stones must be prepared for
transferring the design, made either on
paper or stone, from the paper to stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
or from one stone to another, as there
are colours, and only that part of the design
which is of one colour must appear on one
stone; if you try to get colour prints
in the usual fashion by printing one colour
over the other, you will obtain the usual
commercial muddling lithographic appearance.
But if you mix your own colours for
the lithographer, and have the colours placed
side by side, in flat masses like the Japanese
block prints (<i>see</i> <a href="#chap06">Wood Engraving</a> Lecture),
you should get good results.</p>

<p>There are endless other processes and
methods of work, but they are all more or
less complicated, and require special training
and special tools, and even machinery, and
one who wishes to pursue the subject further
must go to a lithographer and learn the
trade.</p>

<p>But in order to get artistic effects only,
one has but to draw or paint on paper or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
stone as one would ordinarily. The means
are most simple, and the results should be
most interesting.</p>

<span class="lecture">ETCHING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N all the various methods of making illustrations
to which I have so far called
your attention, it was necessary that some
part of the work should be done by a
specially trained craftsman, at least if any
practical and commercial result was desired.</p>

<p>Now in etching, the more you yourselves
do and the less any one else does, the better
should be the result.</p>

<p>An etching is, in its narrowest sense, a print
from a metal plate into which a design has
been bitten or eaten by acid; again, in most
of the other methods, the printing was from
relief blocks like type, and therefore those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
illustrations could be printed with type. Now
we have to consider another sort of work,
namely, intaglio, or incised, or sunken work
not printed from the surface, but from lines
cut below it, and therefore unavailable for
letterpress printing. Of course it would be
easy to make a relief block in metal, or an
incised block of wood, to reverse the treatment
in printing, but it would not be natural
or right.</p>

<p>The whole difference is this: if a wood
block has a line cut in the surface and the
whole face is inked with a roller, the line will
print white and the rest of the block black.
If the etching plate is inked and cleaned off,
as is always done, it will print white; if a
line is cut in it, the ink will remain in that
and produce a black line. Of course they
must be printed in appropriate presses.</p>

<p>In its broadest sense an etching may be
produced in any one of a number of ways,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
by the artist, on a metal plate which may be
printed from.</p>

<p>It is never a process or mechanical engraving,
and never was and never will be,
and the attempt to palm off mechanical
blocks or plates is a swindle and a humbug.</p>

<p>Etchings are produced in the following
manner; at least this is the best and simplest
method.</p>

<p>A plate of highly polished copper, zinc, or
even steel, iron, or aluminium is obtained
from the makers, William Longman, of
Johnson&rsquo;s Court, Fleet Street, or from
Messrs. Hughes &amp; Kimber, West Harding
Street, Fetter Lane, or Messrs. Roberson,
99, Long Acre. Copper, however, is the
best and almost universally used. This
should be carefully cleaned with a soft rag
and whiting; then it should be gripped by a
vice with a wooden handle, in one corner,
care being taken to put a piece of soft paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
between the vice and the plate to keep the
teeth of the former from scratching it; heated,
either upon an iron frame with a spirit or
Bunsen lamp under it, or over the gas, until,
if you take a ball of etching ground and
touch the plate with it, the ground melts.
This ground is made of resin, wax, and gum;
the best is made by Sellers in England and
Cadart in France. All these materials can be
bought of Roberson or Hughes &amp; Kimber.
Touch the hot plate in several places with
the ground. It should melt at once; then
take an American etching roller (which I
think you can only obtain at Roberson&rsquo;s) and
go over the plate rapidly with it in every
direction, until the little masses of melted
ground have been spread evenly and thinly
in a film all over it. With a little practice
you should be able to do this in a couple of
minutes, and you can lay in this way (which
is unknown virtually in England) a thinner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
harder, more even and very much better
ground, with less trouble, than in any other.
Heat the plate again a little more, and take
a bundle of wax tapers twisted together by
heating them, light them and pass them
under the face of the plate held, varnished
side downwards, by the vice; do not touch
the plate with the taper, or the varnish,
being still melted, will come off, but go
rapidly back and forward, allowing the flame
only to touch the surface. In a few minutes
the varnish will have been completely
blackened by the smoke. Next, take a
bottle of stopping-out varnish (which you
may as well buy; don&rsquo;t bother to make it)
and cover the back and edges of the plate.
If this is done while the plate is hot, it dries
very fast, and as soon as the plate is cool it
is ready to work on.</p>

<p>This is the first stage. The waxy ground
is put on to protect the plate from the acid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
with which it is to be bitten, and it must be
so well made and well put on, that one can
draw through it, without tearing it up and
without any resistance; also it must adhere
firmly to the plate, where it is not drawn
through, and must resist the acid perfectly in
the untouched parts. The smoking is done
to enable you to see your lines in the copper,
light on dark; this is rather curious at first,
but you will get used to it. The stopping-out
varnish is also to protect the plate, and is
only a cheaper sort of ground dissolved in oil
of lavender or ether. When the plate is
cool, it should be of a brilliant uniform black,
and if there are any dull, smoky-looking
places on it, the ground is burnt. Here the
ground may be rubbed off, or will show
cracks, if you touch it, in these places, and
the varnish should be cleaned off the face
with turpentine, the plate carefully dried and
regrounded. Otherwise the varnish will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
either crack while you are drawing on it,
or come off in the bath of acid, and your
work will be spoiled.</p>

<p>You draw upon the varnished plate with
needles or points; any steel points will do,
from a knitting-needle to the best big point
you can get. The small needles invented by
Mr. Whistler I find the best; but this is a
personal liking. They are of all shapes and
sizes. You may commence and draw in
your entire subject, only remembering that
you must leave your foreground lines further
apart than those in the distance.</p>

<p>You may make your drawing either with
the same needle, all over, or with needles of
different sizes; for though one half of the
art is in the drawing, the other half, and the
really characteristic half, is in the biting.
There is very little to be said about the
drawing, save that you must draw just as
well as ever you can; you will find out almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
immediately that you have the most responsive
tool in your fingers, and that you can
work with it in any direction. Do not
bother, if you use the same needle, because
the drawing looks flat, and the lines are of
the same width; the biting will fix all that.
Draw away; if you are afraid to tackle
the copper straight away with a point,
paint your design on it, with a little
Chinese white, or, if you have a pencil
drawing of the subject, you may make a
tracing from it, and go over that, transferring
it to the plate; or you may turn the
drawing face down and run it through a
copper plate press; the drawing will come off
on the varnished surface in reverse, and if
you are doing a portrait of a place you must
otherwise reverse it yourself. If you wish
to sketch from nature in reverse, put up a
mirror on an easel, and turn your back to
the subject, drawing from the picture in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
mirror, for, you must remember, that any
subject drawn, as you see it, on a copper
plate, or even a wood-block, prints in reverse.</p>

<p>Next, to bite or etch the drawing into the
copper plate, take equal parts of nitric acid
and water and mix them in a glass-stoppered
bottle, some hours before you wish to use
the mixture, for there is enough heat produced
by the chemical action to melt the
ground if it is used at once.</p>

<p>Or have a quantity of what is known as
Dutch mordant made; this is composed of&mdash;</p>

<p>
Two parts Chlorate of Potash,<br />
Ten parts Hydrochloric Acid,<br />
Eighty-eight parts water.<br />
</p>

<p>Next, get an ordinary photographer&rsquo;s porcelain
or rubber bath or tray; lay the plate in
it, pour the acid over it; in a few seconds
bubbles will arise, in all the lines; brush
them away with a feather; leave the plate, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
there is any fine work on it, in the bath for
only two or three minutes, say for a light
sky; take it out with rubber finger-tips or a
stick, for the acid will burn your fingers and
a drop will rot your clothes, staining them
light yellow; wash the plate thoroughly in
clean water, dry it carefully with blotting-paper.
Take some of your stopping-out
varnish, thin it with a little (a very little)
turpentine, paint over the very lightest parts
of the drawing with a camel&rsquo;s-hair brush
dipped in the diluted varnish, and thus stop
them out&mdash;that is, stop them from biting any
more by painting them with the varnish.
Wait till the places where you have painted
the varnish are thoroughly dry; then put the
plate in the bath again and bite the next
stronger, nearer set of lines; of course, save
where the lines are covered by the stopping-out
varnish, they will keep on biting.
Continue biting and stopping out till you get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
to the foreground, where the lines should now
be quite broad and deep; take off the ground
front and back by washing it with a rag
dipped in turpentine, dry it, and the plate is
ready to print from.</p>

<p>Another method is to commence by drawing
in the darks, biting them, then drawing
in the middle distance, the darks going on
biting all the while, and finally the extreme
distance, when the whole plate will be biting
together; by this method no stopping out is
necessary, but in working out of doors it is
awkward to carry baths and acid around with
one, otherwise one must run back to the
studio, to bite between each stage. But
these two methods can be mixed up, and
frequently are, and you may also work in the
bath, drawing lines through or over others,
thus getting richness while the biting is going
on. The bad fumes which are given off
during the biting are not dangerous. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
working with the Dutch mordant, which
bites slower than nitric acid and makes
no bubbles, but bites straight down, while
nitric acid enlarges the lines laterally, you
will inhale much of the fumes, but they
won&rsquo;t hurt you. Although you do not see
any action with the Dutch mordant, brush
the lines with a feather, else a deposit is
formed and they will bite unevenly.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to tell when a plate is
well bitten, the biting is very difficult, but on
taking it out of the bath and holding it on a
level with your eye, you can see the bitten
lines; you can also feel the biting with a
needle, and you may take off a bit of the
varnish with your thumb-nail or turpentine
and look at the lines, re-covering them again
with the stopping-out varnish; but after this,
of course, they will not bite in that place.</p>

<p>Again, the lines do not bite evenly; where
they are close together they bite faster, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
after the plate has been in the acid some
time, it may change its speed of biting;
differences of atmosphere and temperature
affect it even with the same acid on the
same day; if the nitric acid is too weak
add more acid; if too strong pour in
water, and quick, else the ground will come
off: it is too strong when it boils and
bubbles all over; it is too weak when there
are no bubbles. Dutch mordant eats always
slowly, and never, so far as I know, destroys
the ground. At the last, for very strong
darks, you may sometimes use a little pure
nitric acid, but it will most likely tear up the
ground, and if you leave it long enough will
spoil all your lines, giving you only a great
black hole. These are the systems employed
by all etchers; the lengthy dissertations about
white ground, silver ground, positive and
negative processes, need not concern you,
they are never practised, and mostly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
unknown to the best men. These simple
directions should enable you to produce
artistic plates, if you have the necessary
ability. Still, when you have had a proof
of your plate pulled&mdash;I will talk of printing
in the next lecture&mdash;you will find that there
are all sorts of imperfections in it, possibly
holes, places where it is not bitten enough or
too much bitten, or that it is too dark or too
light all over; it is but seldom that a plate
is right when the first proof is pulled. If
you find a hole bitten in it, take a burnishing
tool, flatten the hole down as much as
possible, find the place on the back with
a pair of calipers, hammer it up from the
back, placing it on an anvil, burnish it again
and polish the surface with charcoal, oil, and
rags; revarnish the place, redraw, and rebite
it. If it is only a small place you may take
up some nitric acid on a feather, and paint
the little spot to be rebitten with that. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
few drops of the acid have nearly as much
power as a great deal. In fact you may
paint the face of your plate with acid and do
your biting in that way, without ever immersing
it in the bath at all. If it is too
much bitten it must be rubbed down with
charcoal and oil, a tedious process. If it
is too light it must be rebitten all over; then
take a rebiting roller, putting some liquid
etching ground on a separate plate, take
the ground up on the roller and roll the face
of the plate very carefully; the ground
should cover the face without going into
any of the lines; heat it very slightly to
dry the ground, leave it for a day or so
and then bite as before. If there are
places where lines want joining or little
touches of dark would be effective, put them
in with a graver or a point.</p>

<p>You may use a graver altogether, and
produce a line engraving; or a point,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
either steel or diamond, and make what
is known as a dry-point etching, that
is, merely a scratched drawing on the
copper; the point throws up, as you draw
with it, a furrow, which is greater or less as
you incline the point, and this holds the
ink, and is called burr, and gives for a few
proofs great richness; a steel face can, however,
be put on the copper plate, and any
number of pulls may be taken. The difference
between the cutting of lines with a
graver and the drawing of them with a point
is this: the graver, both in metal and wood,
is pushed from one; the point in etching,
and even the knives in wood cutting, are
drawn toward one.</p>

<p>Messrs. Roberson have invented a plate
of celluloid which, for dry point work, seems
to be fairly good, and as this plate is white
or cream-coloured, as one draws on it the
lines may be filled up with paint, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
may thus see the drawing as one works. Of
course, the same thing may be done with
dry point on copper. The great advantage
of the celluloid is its lightness. It must not,
however, be heated in printing, otherwise it
will be ruined. Many etchers are now
making experiments with aluminium, but no
certain results have as yet been obtained.</p>

<p>There are many other forms of engraving
included under the title of Etching, although,
properly speaking, they have nothing to do
with it.</p>

<p>Aquatint: a ground, made by depositing
powdered resin in solution with spirits
of wine, is poured on the plate, slightly
heated, and as it dries the resin adheres to
the plate and cracks up irregularly; a drawing
may be made on this, and stopped out
in the usual way. Or powdered resin may
be sprinkled on the plate, heated, when it
will adhere, or the plate may be placed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
a box containing resin in very fine powder,
heated, and the box shaken; the resin will
settle on it and produce the ground.</p>

<p>A very similar ground may be made by
passing the ordinarily-grounded plate through
a copper-plate printing-press, with a piece
of sandpaper over it, three or four times,
then the design may be painted on it in
stopping-out varnish, and at times a very
good result may be obtained. Lines may
be put in, etched before the ground is laid;
but personally I don&rsquo;t like the lines at all;
without them the result is rather like a
bitten painting. Silk and canvas can also
be placed on the grounded plate, which is
then run through the press, to get tints in
the ground.</p>

<p>Tints may be obtained after the plate is
bitten by painting it with olive oil and
sprinkling flowers of sulphur on it, which
gives a very charming tint, but it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
last long; I believe that if acid is poured
over it, it may last better. Mr. Frank
Short says so, but I have never tried the
experiment.</p>

<p>Soft ground etchings are made by mixing
etching ground and tallow together in equal
proportions, covering the plate with this
composition by means of the roller: that is,
put some of the composition on a clean
plate, pass the roller over it till it is covered
with the soft ground, and then roll it on to
the plate on which you propose to work,
smoke it and then stretch a piece of rough-grained
or lined drawing paper over the
face, as paper is stretched for making
water-colours, draw upon this with a lead
pencil and then carefully take the paper
off; you must not rest on or touch the
plate with your fingers; the ground comes
away with the paper where the pencil
has passed, and the design is seen on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
copper, and is then to be bitten in as in
ordinary etching.</p>

<p>Mezzotint is also included, for some unknown
reason, with etching. The face of
the plate is roughened in every direction
by going over it with a toothed instrument
called a rocker, until it will print perfectly
black; the design is then traced on it; the
drawing is made by scraping down the
lights, and finally by burnishing the whites
quite smooth.</p>

<p>Tint effects can also be obtained by a
smooth-toothed wheel, the roulette, the same
as that used by process engravers; only
here it produces blacks, while they use it
to get lights.</p>

<p>Monotypes, that is paintings made in
colour or black and white on a bare copper
plate in the usual way, though they must
be handled thinly, may be passed through
the press, and they will yield one exquisitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
soft and delicate impression. The electrotyping
and duplicating of them changes
their character and value entirely: it is a
ridiculous and inartistic proceeding.</p>

<p>But after going through all this list,&mdash;I
have barely referred to steel engraving in
line, which, as I have said, is only working
with an ordinary graver in steel, and is slow
and tedious, unsatisfactory drudgery; or
to stipple engraving, dotting and biting in
dots, instead of lines, as practised by Bartolozzi,&mdash;one
comes back to the simple
method I described at first, the method
with some improvements of Rembrandt,
the method of Whistler, or in dry point
the method of Helleu; and what is good
enough for those masters should be good
enough for you.</p>

<br />
<span class="lecture">THE PRINTING OF ETCHINGS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HICH is the more interesting and
amusing&mdash;the drawing, biting, or
printing of an etching has never been
decided. But no artist is willing, if he can
help it, to allow any one else, once he has
mastered the method of work, to perform
any part of the operation for him.</p>

<p>The printing of an etching is, in theory,
very simple; in practice, it is most difficult,
but most delightful.</p>

<p>The plate being bitten, as I have described
in a previous lecture, must now be printed,
for the prints from it, and not the plate itself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
are the end of etching&mdash;really of all illustration.</p>

<p>You will have to spend several pounds
on an etching outfit, so you had better get
a good one. The small ones, including press,
ink, chemicals, quite complete, sold by Roberson,
of 99, Long Acre, are most excellent
as far as they go, for small plates, and taking
round the country with one on a sketching
tour; but for serious work, a more practical
set of tools is necessary. Therefore I would
advise you first to take lessons of a good
etcher, who will allow you to work with him,
or to go to a printer and get him to show
you how the work is done.</p>

<p>This is the method: the first thing to do
is to obtain some good handmade paper,
almost all old paper is excellent; it should
be unruled, of course; often the tone of it
is lovely, and it may contain most beautiful
water-marks. I am referring to Dutch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
French, English, or German papers of at
least a century old. At times you may be able
to pick up old ledgers, account-books, or
packages of unprinted paper; treasure them
up; if you don&rsquo;t print etchings on them, there
is nothing more delightful to draw upon.
There are also Japanese and India papers,
which give most beautiful delicate translucent
effect to prints. Vellum, parchment, and
even silk or satin may be printed on. But
as a general rule the old handmade Dutch
paper is the most satisfactory, if you can
get it. For ordinary work and experiments,
modern paper is quite good enough, and
very good handmade paper can be obtained
from Roberson&rsquo;s. Let us suppose you are
going to print; twenty-four hours before,
take several sheets of paper, rather more
than you want, in case of failure or for any
other reason; cut the sheets the size you
desire them, a little larger than the plate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
so as to leave a decent margin. Cut the
paper first; Japanese paper, for example,
cannot easily be cut when it is wet. Get
a sheet of window glass, lay it flat on a table,
take the first sheet of paper and damp it on
one side by passing a wet sponge over it,
lay it on the glass; on top of this sheet lay
another dry one; damp the top of that with
the sponge; and continue laying down sheets
and damping their upper faces till you have
enough; put another sheet of window glass
on the top, and a heavy weight upon it; in
a day the whole mass should be completely
dampened all through. I believe the same
thing can be done by a copying press and
book, and I have heard it is so done by
lithographers, but the way I have described
is the usual one that is followed by plate
printers. The next thing is the press. A
good secondhand one may be bought at
Hughes &amp; Kimber&rsquo;s, West Harding Street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
Fetter Lane, for about five pounds. Much
depends, however, on the size and finish.
You should have it brought to your studio,
set up and adjusted for you by skilled workmen.
Then you must buy a heater and a
jigger for your plates, ink, oil, canvas, and
a number of other things, dabbers, a muller,
an ink-slab, and a big palette knife; all these
will run up a bill of ten pounds or so.</p>

<p>But having your press and other things,
let us go to work: light the gas-burners
under the heater which you have bought;
if too much flame comes out and makes the
iron top too hot, plug up some of the jets.
Put your plate on the top of the heater.
First, however, see that your press is adjusted,
so that the plate will fit in. To do
this, put a piece of paper on the top of the
plate and run it in the press to try it, and see
if it goes under the roller without tearing the
paper. Take some of the ink out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
can, or better, get it in powder, put it on
the ink-slab and mix it with oil with the
palette knife; then take the muller and grind
the ink until it is thoroughly ground and
mixed and of about the thickness of paint
as it comes out of the tube. But each plate
will require more or less oil or colour, and
some brown, red, or possibly blue mixed
with it to take off the crude raw look which
pure black often has in the print. The plate
being now warm, not so hot as to boil or
burn the ink, dab with a dabber the ink
from the slab all over the face of the plate
(it is warmed to wipe the ink off easily), slide
it from the heater to the wooden box called
a jigger, which must be placed alongside
the former. You should get a printer to
arrange your things for you. Take a piece
of the rag or canvas for wiping, double it
carefully and loosely in your hand&mdash;this
requires much practice&mdash;and remove all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
ink which is on the surface of the plate.
Even after you have wiped it some time, an
oily film will remain, which, unless you polish
the plate with whiting rubbed on your
hand, you cannot remove, and you do not
want to, because the oil gives a delicious
tone to the print. Some ink may be left
in places on the surface to increase and
strengthen the work, but what you must
learn to do is not to wipe any of the ink out
of the bitten lines. This is very difficult,
and if you do wipe it out, you must commence
all over again, only the chances are
that you will know nothing about this until
the plate is printed. The colour may also
be increased by going over the surface of the
plate, having again warmed it, if it has become
cool, with a bit of soft taffatas silk
with a trembling muscular motion of the arm
and fingers. This action, called retroussage,
which must be seen to be understood, drags
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
the ink slightly over the surface of the plate
without taking much out of the lines.</p>

<p>Now take off the weights from your paper,
take up a sheet, which should be thoroughly
damped, first brushing it with a soft brush
to remove any drops of water or dirt or dust.
The paper should be placed near the press.
Put the plate face upwards on the press,
on which the blankets have been properly
arranged&mdash;you must see this done for yourselves&mdash;the
plate underneath of course; lay
the sheet of damp paper on the face of the
plate and run it through the press once; it
is well to put a sheet of ordinary thick paper
on the top of the damp sheet, otherwise the
latter will stick to the blankets; raise the
blankets and take up the first sheet of paper,
the print will most likely adhere to that, if it
does not, take it up carefully by one edge, it
will come away from the copper, and you
will find the print on the under side of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
Japanese and India prints require very careful
handling, especially the latter. They are
usually printed on to a sheet of plate paper
by dusting it, or the back of the India paper,
with flour; this, on passing through the press,
is made into paste by the dampness of the
India paper, and they are thus moulded
together.</p>

<p>As soon as the prints are taken off the
press, put them between sheets of blotting
paper and allow them to dry for some time,
they will come out flat; if you neglect this,
they will crinkle up very badly, and are
difficult to get smooth again.</p>

<p>This is the way a copper plate is printed,
but you must see it done and practise for a
long time before you can do it decently.</p>

<p>Colour prints from copper plates may be
made in one or more ways. The various
colours may be put on by applying them
where they are wanted with stumps, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
plate may be painted by applying the colours
with brushes. Several plates may be used,
just as in lithography or coloured block
printing, and these coloured plates wiped as
I have been describing. Many prints, however,
are coloured by hand after they are
printed.</p>

<p>Mezzotints, acquatints, steel engravings,
&amp;c., are printed in the same way as copper-plates.
The rubbing with the canvas and
the hand, and the tremendous pressure to
which the plates are subjected, quickly spoil
the clearness and sharpness of the lines;
therefore if any large number of prints are
wanted, a coating of steel is put on the
face of the copper-plate by steel-plating it;
this protects the copper, and as soon as the
steel facing shows signs of wear it may be
removed, and a new film of steel applied;
hence an unlimited edition can be printed
in time from a copper plate. If it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
necessary that the printing should be done
more rapidly, electrotypes can be made
from the original copper-plate (<i>see</i> <a href="#chap11">electrotype
and stereotype</a> Lecture), and several
printers can then work on these electrotypes
at the same time. The electrotypes are
rarely equal to the originals.</p>

<p>Such is a brief outline of the method of
printing copper plates; but I cannot too
strongly impress upon you the fact that it is
a handicraft which, though most interesting,
requires long apprenticeship, with a master
printer, and in one&rsquo;s studio, before good
results can be obtained.</p>

ETC.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HESE processes or methods of reproduction
are the outcome of the
endeavour to supersede the artist and engraver.
They are quite mechanical, or
should be; in fact the less evidence there
is of any intervention on the part of the
operator or maker of a photographic plate,
the better it will be for the work which
is being reproduced; still, if an artist turns
his attention to these processes, the finest
results are obtained, even though he must
completely efface himself in the work. M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Amand Durand made the best photogravures
ever produced because he was an
artist. No mere photographic or mechanical
engraver ever approached him.</p>

<p>The theory of photogravure and photo-lithography,
in the best work, is the same
as that of photo-engraving, which is described
in a previous Lecture. In photogravure a
photograph of a drawing is usually made on
a sensitised copper plate; this is coated with
some acid-resisting varnish, but when the
varnished plate is washed with water or
some acid, the varnish covering the picture
on the plate comes away, leaving the picture
on the bare copper. This is then bitten in
exactly the same way as an etching, the
success of the plate depending entirely on
the artistic intelligence of the person who
does the biting. Or else the photographic
print is made on the varnish itself just
exactly in the same way as for a zinc block;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
only in this case the picture is washed away
and not the surrounding portions; the biting
is then proceeded with.</p>

<p>There are also many other processes
of photogravure, while heliotype, autotype,
Woodbury-type, collotype, are closely allied
to it. The word type is probably used
simply because by none of these methods
can the plates be used with letterpress. All
these processes, however, are very complicated,
require expensive machinery, are quite
outside the field of art, most secret, and,
except theoretically, of little importance to
you.</p>

<p>A good photogravure, for example, by
Amand Durand or Ch. Dujardin is often
a most excellent reproduction of a line-drawing
or an etching&mdash;so good, in fact,
as to be almost indistinguishable from an
etching. But to endeavour to palm off pen
drawings as etchings, when they have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
reproduced in some such way, is to act the
part of a common swindler.</p>

<p>Photo-lithography is exactly the same as
photo-zincography&mdash;process block-making.
The drawing is photographed on to transfer
paper, covered with lithographic ink and
transferred to the stone like any other lithograph.
This is a mechanical process; there
are a number of ways of getting the drawing
on to the stone, and the results are described
under many names. Collotypes and other
varieties of photographic prints are made
from gelatine or other films; they require
expensive machines to produce, they are all
mechanical processes which you could not
readily use unless you went into the business,
and are quite outside your art.</p>

<p>One is being continually shown processes
which are going to revolutionise engraving
and incidentally do away with the artist;
this has not yet been accomplished. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
just as one sees to-day the momentary
triumph of the photographer&mdash;or rather of
the person who is exploiting the poor photographer&mdash;one
may remember that chromos
have not annihilated painting, nor can the
photograph ever be anything more than a
useful aid to illustration.</p>

<br />
<span class="lecture">MAKING READY FOR THE PRINTING PRESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>AVING made your drawing, had it
reproduced by one of the methods
I described, you must now have it printed.</p>

<p>Excepting in the case of very limited fine
editions of not more than one hundred
copies, the original plates or blocks on which
the designs have been engraved are very
seldom used, because if anything should
happen to the blocks or plates they would
have to be done over again. So copies of
them, called electrotypes and sometimes
stereotypes, are made. The electrotype of a
wood or metal block or plate is produced in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
the same way as an electrotype of any other
object, by usually taking a wax cast of it,
putting the cast in an electrotyping bath,
when a shell of copper is deposited upon it.
As many of these wax casts may be made as
are wanted, and as many shells are deposited
as desired. These copper shells are then
backed up with wood or metal and are ready
to print from. They are wonderfully cheaply
and quickly turned out, and in the case of
magazines and books, for which a large
circulation is expected, are always used; and
it is almost, with good work, impossible to tell
the difference between the electrotype, and
the original; from a process block or wood
engraving, while the original block is preserved
for making additional electrotypes for
future editions. In the case of cheap books,
or newspapers with illustrations, the <i>Daily
Graphic</i>, for example&mdash;the <i>Chronicle</i> was
printed almost altogether from the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
blocks, or electrotypes&mdash;the page of type is
set up with the original blocks in it, and this
is stereotyped to print from; that is, a papier
mach&eacute; mould is made of the entire page of
type and illustrations, either by pounding
down on to it, with a heavy brush, a thick
sheet of papier mach&eacute; till the entire page is
moulded into the pulpy papier mach&eacute;, or by
covering it with successive sheets of thin
damp paper until a solid mould or matrix of
paper is made on the type; this matrix is
hardened and placed in a curved steel case,
and type metal poured into the case upon the
paper mould; as soon as the type metal has
cooled it is taken out, and a perfect cast of
the page is seen in metal, curved so that it
will fit on the cylinder of the printing press.
If there are no illustrations, it may be printed
right off, without further preparation; but if
the page contains illustrations, in order to get
the proper amount of colour on the blacks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
and the delicacy of the greys, little pieces of
paper must be put over and under the illustrations,
on the printing press, to bring out
their colour, by increasing or lessening the
pressure. This is the way in which it is
done: a man, called the overlay cutter, has
several proofs of the illustration given him,
and he cuts them out so as to produce a
series of skeleton designs, one containing
only the blacks, another the blacks and dark
greys, the third the blacks, dark and light
greys, and so on; these he pastes on the top
of each other, forming the picture in relief,
and this relief picture is either placed under
the block to be printed from, or else on the
opposite cylinder under the paper on which
the picture is to be printed&mdash;it must be put
on very accurately and firmly, for if it slips
it will ruin the whole page. All this work
connected with printing is most interesting,
most complicated, and most wonderfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
performed. In order to understand it thoroughly,
you must go and work in a printing office;
all illustrators should learn at least how overlays
are made, how to correct them, and how
to work on blocks or electros, though this is
really the duty of the engraver; when they
are on the printing press, little things may
happen which may make or mar a whole
book, which only the artist can detect, and
which he should be able to set right. Therefore
if you are making a beautiful book, you
should not only see all the engraver&rsquo;s proofs
of your drawings, but the printer&rsquo;s proofs as
well; all this requires much work and more
knowledge, but unless you care enough about
your work to acquire this knowledge, I doubt
if you will ever be a great success as an illustrator&mdash;that
is, artistically.</p>

<p>Very much has been said lately about the
artist considering the limitations of the printing
press, the paper, and ink. Really to-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
with the best engravers, the best printers
and paper-makers, there are no limits to the
possibilities of reproducing and printing
drawings. The limits are the depth of the
publisher&rsquo;s pocket. Almost any drawing
whatever can be reproduced very well, by
some means, provided the editor or publisher
will pay the price charged for having it reproduced,
and the engravers and printers have
the knowledge of their craft to reproduce it.
And if the book or magazine will stand the
expense, it very likely will pay the publisher.
But if you are working for a magazine, it is
not likely that the proprietors can afford
photogravures, therefore your work must be
made so that it will reproduce well by wood
engraving or process. And the necessity for
attention to the mechanical requirements of
drawing, engraving, and printing increase, as
the price of the book or paper decreases,
until when one comes down, financially, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
the halfpenny papers, only those drawings
can be used which will print at the utmost
speed, and with the least care bestowed upon
them, in poor ink and cheap paper. Still,
there is no reason why the artistic quality
also should degenerate; there are men at
work to-day whose drawings would look just
as well in the halfpenny evening papers as in
a three-guinea book, and these men are to be
congratulated on their perfect mastery of the
cheaper methods of reproduction. Therefore
try to do good work in your own way, and
do not bother about anything but whether
it will look well on the printed page.</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
